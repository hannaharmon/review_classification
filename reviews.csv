label,review
1,This sound track was beautiful! It paints the senery in your mind so well I would recomend it even to people who hate vid. game music! I have played the game Chrono Cross but out of all of the games I have ever played it has the best music! It backs away from crude keyboarding and takes a fresher step with grate guitars and soulful orchestras. It would impress anyone who cares to listen! ^_^
1,"I'm reading a lot of reviews saying that this is the best 'game soundtrack' and I figured that I'd write a review to disagree a bit. This in my opinino is Yasunori Mitsuda's ultimate masterpiece. The music is timeless and I'm been listening to it for years now and its beauty simply refuses to fade.The price tag on this is pretty staggering I must say, but if you are going to buy any cd for this much money, this is the only one that I feel would be worth every penny."
1,"This soundtrack is my favorite music of all time, hands down. The intense sadness of ""Prisoners of Fate"" (which means all the more if you've played the game) and the hope in ""A Distant Promise"" and ""Girl who Stole the Star"" have been an important inspiration to me personally throughout my teen years. The higher energy tracks like ""Chrono Cross ~ Time's Scar~"", ""Time of the Dreamwatch"", and ""Chronomantique"" (indefinably remeniscent of Chrono Trigger) are all absolutely superb as well.This soundtrack is amazing music, probably the best of this composer's work (I haven't heard the Xenogears soundtrack, so I can't say for sure), and even if you've never played the game, it would be worth twice the price to buy it.I wish I could give it 6 stars."
1,"I truly like this soundtrack and I enjoy video game music. I have played this game and most of the music on here I enjoy and it's truly relaxing and peaceful.On disk one. my favorites are Scars Of Time, Between Life and Death, Forest Of Illusion, Fortress of Ancient Dragons, Lost Fragment, and Drowned Valley.Disk Two: The Draggons, Galdorb - Home, Chronomantique, Prisoners of Fate, Gale, and my girlfriend likes ZelbessDisk Three: The best of the three. Garden Of God, Chronopolis, Fates, Jellyfish sea, Burning Orphange, Dragon's Prayer, Tower Of Stars, Dragon God, and Radical Dreamers - Unstealable Jewel.Overall, this is a excellent soundtrack and should be brought by those that like video game music.Xander Cross"
1,"If you've played the game, you know how divine the music is! Every single song tells a story of the game, it's that good! The greatest songs are without a doubt, Chrono Cross: Time's Scar, Magical Dreamers: The Wind, The Stars, and the Sea and Radical Dreamers: Unstolen Jewel. (Translation varies) This music is perfect if you ask me, the best it can be. Yasunori Mitsuda just poured his heart on and wrote it down on paper."
1,"I am quite sure any of you actually taking the time to read this have played the game at least once, and heard at least a few of the tracks here. And whether you were aware of it or not, Mitsuda's music contributed greatly to the mood of every single minute of the whole game.Composed of 3 CDs and quite a few songs (I haven't an exact count), all of which are heart-rendering and impressively remarkable, this soundtrack is one I assure you you will not forget. It has everything for every listener -- from fast-paced and energetic (Dancing the Tokage or Termina Home), to slower and more haunting (Dragon God), to purely beautifully composed (Time's Scar), to even some fantastic vocals (Radical Dreamers).This is one of the best videogame soundtracks out there, and surely Mitsuda's best ever. ^_^"
1,"This is a self-published book, and if you want to know why--read a few paragraphs! Those 5 star reviews must have been written by Ms. Haddon's family and friends--or perhaps, by herself! I can't imagine anyone reading the whole thing--I spent an evening with the book and a friend and we were in hysterics reading bits and pieces of it to one another. It is most definitely bad enough to be entered into some kind of a ""worst book"" contest. I can't believe Amazon even sells this kind of thing. Maybe I can offer them my 8th grade term paper on ""To Kill a Mockingbird""--a book I am quite sure Ms. Haddon never heard of. Anyway, unless you are in a mood to send a book to someone as a joke---stay far, far away from this one!"
1,"I loved Whisper of the wicked saints. The story was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised at the changes in the book. I am not normaly someone who is into romance novels, but the world was raving about this book and so I bought it. I loved it !! This is a brilliant story because it is so true. This book was so wonderful that I have told all of my friends to read it. It is not a typical romance, it is so much more. Not reading this book is a crime, becuase you are missing out on a heart warming story."
1,"I just finished reading Whisper of the Wicked saints. I fell in love with the caracters. I expected an average romance read, but instead I found one of my favorite books of all time. Just when I thought I could predict the outcome I was shocked ! The writting was so descriptive that my heart broke when Julia's did and I felt as if I was there with them instead of just a distant reader. If you are a lover of romance novels then this is a must read. Don't let the cover fool you this book is spectacular!"
1,"This was a easy to read book that made me want to keep reading on and on, not easy to put down.It left me wanting to read the follow on, which I hope is coming soon. I used to read a lot but have gotten away from it. This book made me want to read again. Very enjoyable."
1,"A complete waste of time. Typographical errors, poor grammar, and a totally pathetic plot add up to absolutely nothing. I'm embarrassed for this author and very disappointed I actually paid for this book."
1,"This was a great book,I just could not put it down,and could not read it fast enough. Boy what a book the twist and turns in this just keeps you guessing and wanting to know what is going to happen next. This book makes you fall in love and can heat you up,it can also make you so angery. this book can make you go throu several of your emotions. This is a quick read romance. It is something that you will want to end your day off with if you read at night."
1,"I thought this book was brilliant, but yet realistic. It showed me that to error is human. I loved the fact that this writer showed the loving side of God and not the revengeful side of him. I loved how it twisted and turned and I could not put it down. I also loved The glass castle."
1,"I guess you have to be a romance novel lover for this one, and not a very discerning one. All others beware! It is absolute drivel. I figured I was in trouble when a typo is prominently featured on the back cover, but the first page of the book removed all doubt. Wait - maybe I'm missing the point. A quick re-read of the beginning now makes it clear. This has to be an intentional churning of over-heated prose for satiric purposes. Phew, so glad I didn't waste $10.95 after all."
1,"I feel I have to write to keep others from wasting their money. This book seems to have been written by a 7th grader with poor grammatical skills for her age! As another reviewer points out, there is a misspelling on the cover, and I believe there is at least one per chapter. For example, it was mentioned twice that she had a ""lean"" on her house. I was so distracted by the poor writing and weak plot, that I decided to read with a pencil in hand to mark all of the horrible grammar and spelling. Please don't waste your money. I too, believe that the good reviews must have been written by the author's relatives. I will not put much faith in the reviews from now on!"
1,"It's glaringly obvious that all of the glowing reviews have been written by the same person, perhaps the author herself. They all have the same misspellings and poor sentence structure that is featured in the book. Who made Veronica Haddon think she is an author?"
1,"When you hear folks say that they don't make 'em like that anymore, they might be talking about ""BY THE SEA"". This is a very cool story about a young Cuban girl searching for idenity who stumbles into a coastal resort kitchen gig with a zen motorcycle maintenance man, three hysterical Italian chefs and a Latino fireballing right handed pitcher who plays on the team sponsored by the resort's owner. As is often the case she 'finds' herself through honest, often comical but always emotional, interaction with this sizzling roster of players. With the perfect mix of special effects, that salsa sound and flashbacks, BY THE SEA, gets 4 BIG stars from me!"
1,"After I had a DVT my doctor required me to wear compression stockings. I wore ugly white TED hose and yucky thick brown stockings. Then I found Jobst UltraSheer. They gave me the compression I needed (15-20,) but looked like regular pantyhose. Even though my blood clot has been gone for 4 years, I still buy these to wear as support stockings because they make my legs feel so nice.**Note, I have problems with the rubberized tops rolling down my thigh. I tried the Jobst adhesive, but I hated having my skin pulled all day. I bought an inexpensive garter belt and it works fine and helps keep the stockings from rolling."
1,"Excellent product. However, they are very difficult to get on for older people. I feel like I've had a full day workout after getting them on. Also, as the day wears on, they begin to roll down from the top and create a very deep ridge in the skin. I have to wear them, so if those two difficulties could be addressed it would be such a help."
1,sizes are much smaller than what is recomended in the chart. I tried to put it and sheer it!. I guess you should not buy this item in the internet..it is better to go to the store and check it
1,"This model may be ok for sedentary types, but I'm active and get around alot in my job - consistently found these stockings rolled up down by my ankles! Not Good!! Solution: go with the standard compression stocking, 20-30, stock #114622. Excellent support, stays up and gives me what I need. Both pair of these also tore as I struggled to pull them up all the time. Good riddance/bad investment!"
1,"I thought it was funny that I bought this product without knowing it was a mix. I read the header very quickly and just thought it was packaged cookies. But no, it is cookie MIX and I guess I should have noticed that since it is right in the title.This is the first time I have ever tried baking with a cookie mix. If you are used to the convenience of the cookie dough that you buy wrapped up in plastic logs then you might be in for a bit of a surprise. Mixing up the dough can get VERY messy (it is extremely sticky). However, with a cookie mix like this you have a lot of flexibility in the ratio of ingredients (I like to add some extra butter to make the baked cookies more chewy). Also, this mix has really large chocolate chips in it--I love that.I removed a star for the addition of 'natural flavors' in the mix."
1,"Rather than scratches and insect droppings, this one has random pixelations combined with muddy light and vague image resolution. Probably the cue should have been the packaging is straight out of your street corner bootleg dealer.If you've ever seen a reasonably good condition film copy, you know the defining visuals of his film are the crystal clear lighting contrasts in black and white. The surrounding countryside and 'old home' scenes are set with early morning ground mists or the haze of memory while the events on the bridge and in the water are bright, clear, and immediate.Here everything is dull, dark, and clouded. Or, if you remember the timbre and enunciation of Captain's commands, so are the visuals.After that, it is hard to believe this award winning, critically acclaimed film's best presentation is on YOUTUBE. Somewhere ""out there"" is a DVD that comes up to the standard of a 16mm public library reel.Just none of them appear to be on Amazon."
1,"I thoroughly enjoyed Rising Sons and Daughters. I don't know of any other book that looks at Japanese society from the point of view of its young people poised as they are between their parents' age-old Japanese culture of restraint and obedience to the will of the community, and their peers' adulation of Western culture. True to form, the ""New Young"" of Japan seem to be creating an ""international"" blend, as the Ando family demonstrates in this beautifully written book of vignettes of the private lives of members of this family. Steven Wardell is clearly a talented young author, adopted for some of his schooling into this family of four teens, and thus able to view family life in Japan from the inside out. A great read!"
1,"I heard a song or two and thought same o same o,but when i listened to songs like ""blue angel"",""lanna"" and 'mama"" the hair just rose off my neck.Roy is trully an amazing singer with a talent you don't find much now days."
1,"I have had the charger for more than two years. It charges AA batteries just fine, but has a huge problem securing smaller AAA batteries. To charge the smaller batteries you need to flip down the little button at the positive end. In the beginning one of the four AAA batteries would pop up, and now three out of the four won't hold. The problem is the flip mechanism became loose, and any horizontal pressure would push the buttons back up. What I have to do now is using duct tape and a segment of crayon, apply the crayon on the buttons, and wrap the tape around. You know how painful that is."
1,"I bought one of these chargers..the instructions say the lights stay on while the battery charges...true. The instructions doNT say the lights turn off when its done. Which is also true. 24 hours of charging and the lights stay on. I returned it thinking I had a bad unit.The new one did the same thing. I just kept it since it does charge...but the lights are useless since they seem to always stay on. It's a ""backup"" charger for when I manage to drain all my AAs but I wouldn't want this as my only charger."
1,"I read the reviews,made my purchase and was very disappointed. The charger is convenient by charging all four batteries at once but the charge only lasts a very short time. I now have to go and find batteries that will give me longer life than the kodak NiMH AA batteries."
1,"I was excited to find a book ostensibly about Muslim feminism, but this volume did not live up to the expectations.One essay, among other things, describes the veil as potentially liberating. It doesn't begin to explain how or why.Another, on Muslim women in Cape Town, claims that Muslim women there are separate but ""more than equal."" Gee whiz, what a disappointment.I had expected and hoped for at least one Muslim feminist condemnation of gender apartheid. But there is not a single one in the book.I'm surprised it didn't have an essay extolling the virtues of female genital mutilation.--Alyssa A. Lappen"
1,"This VCR/DVD was an early Christmas present to myself after deciding to join the rest of the world in DVD-land but not wanting to let go of my VHS movies quite yet. Based on the reviews and price, and because I own a JVC TV, this was my choice. I agree with the easy set-up. It's a bit awkward to work the whole TV/VHS/DVD selection options but I think I've gotten the hang of it.Two comments: it's not intuitive and actually is pretty complicated (too many buttons on the remote but that might please others who are more technically-minded than me) so I've had to rely heavily on the how-to manual. And setting the VCR timer is awkward -- you can't enter the start and end time but have to scroll (unless I'm missing something)...but those are my only complaints. This is a good product for your $$$."
1,"I am a big JVC fan, but I do not like this model, I was suspiscious when I saw several units in the return section of the store. I bought one anyway (new) and must say I am not happy. The unit sends out clicks to the receiver once in a while, the transition between scenes is not always smooth,(like a little pause) and while it is still fairly new I can't get any DVD,CD or even a DVD headcleaner to work. All I get is a ""incorrect disc"" message."
1,"I'm a JVC nut...I have 3 JVC televisions, one VCR, one bookshelf audio system and car audio system. So when it came time to move the VCR player to the boys room and get another one for the old man I knew what make it was going to be. I decided on the combo player because I don't think VHS is going to be around much longer. I like my combo player except for 2 things:(1)no cable box compatability on the remote control (2)no seperate audio video inputs only input for coax cable from my cable box so all of the cable programming is in mono...wife can't tell the difference in the sound so if she's happy then I'll just live with it. VCR and DVD look and sound GREAT!!!!!!!"
1,"The plot is so ridiculous, I have to wonder if they even read the script before making this film. The mountain lion breaks out of his trailer - and the cars behind don't notice? The mountain lion is captured - and put in a jail cell? Get real! Utterly, completely stupid."
1,"Hotel Babylon is not just good TV...it's great TV!!!! The show features some incredible acting from Tamzin Outhwaite (formerly of EastEnders, a BBC soap) and Max Beesley (from the ill-fated movie ""Glitter"" starring Mariah Carey). The show could make for a great drama series, but I felt that it is a mix of a drama, comedy, and soap opera all mixed into a great BBC show. The show aired on BBC America for a while but didn't get around to seeing it. I can now say that I got the DVD set and all the episodes are great. The season finale was an interesting to watch.The show reminds me of Hotel which aired on ABC from 1983 to 1988. The reason...Hotel was set at a fictional San Francisco hotel as Hotel Babylon was set at a luxury five-star hotel in England.I recommend this DVD to anyone who is willing to watch a great show from the BBC."
1,"If you have even casually looked into applying to law school, have already read everything there is in this book, do not waste your money, seriously!!"
1,"When I first ordered the CD, I figured it was going to be a hip, cool daddy vibe CD. However much to my dismay it sounds like a fourth grade music class. The main jist of the CD is that there is a xylaphone playing over peoples voices trying to replicate happening party. I believe if I played this CD at a party anywhere in my neighborhood I would get laughed off the beach. Growing up a surfer in San Diego, I would not recommend this CD to any of my Southern California brothers. Honestly, when I played it I kinda of felt I was in a bad B movie. The absolutle epitimy of the CD is the last ""vibe"" Surf Cha Cha. Surfers don't CHA."
1,"Wondering what the hell has happened to the moral aspect of modern American culture ? This book is a lucid, well argued explanation of the simple fact that we have become so totally focused on our individual RIGHTS that we have completely ignored, and even mocked, our personal and public responsibilities. The final response and indictment of Robert Ringer's best seller, LOOKING OUT FOR #1. This is a great time for anyone who is disgusted with the boorish state of American media, politics and discourse in general, to clear their heads for the substantial challenges that lie before us not only as Americans, but as human beings. A great book"
1,"Larry's work for the Muse label in the late 80s and early 90s found him exploring the rich catalog of jazz standards that he probably grew up playing. Surrounding himself with the best musicians around, Larry sounds relaxed, focused, and totally in control. Listen to Larry's take on ""My Funny Valentine"" and tell me it doesn't stand right up there with Chet Baker's or Miles'. A very fine album that you'll enjoy again and again."
1,"It clearly says on line this will work on a Mac OS system. The disk comes and it does not, only Windows . Do Not order this if you have a Mac!!!!!!!"
1,"My three year old son was very excited to get this but after two attempts at playing it hasn't been touched since. You are not able to use the mouse through any of the games except for the ""power-up segments"" instead you are using the up-down arrows on the keyboard - too hard for him and not much fun. Very disapointed with this game and wish I could return it."
1,"This game makes you do the same things over and over, it never holds my son's attention long enough to get to the next level. There is no choice of games you have to do every thing in order. We have another Rescue Heroes game and both my boys 3 and 6 love it, but this one is a dog!"
1,"As a former Alaskan, I didn't want to have to do this. But after repeatedly attempting Allman's recipes and having to throw out 8-10 cups of flour and miscellaneous ingredients nearly every time--and then comparing to Ed Wood's recipes which work flawlessly, and Lisa Rayner's very excellent Wild Bread: Hand-baked sourdough artisan breads in your own kitchen, I can't help but notice that their recipes work, where Allman's fail.I'm not a novice baker. The only thing that worked reliably was the pancakes recipe, but that can be found other places as well.If you are looking for reliable recipes and concise information about starting a sourdough and maintaining it, I recommend any of Ed Wood's books, even his very old ones. Lisa Rayner has written a fabulous tome in Wild Bread. But pass on this book.While some of the historical vignettes were interesting--not enough so to warrant the cost of the book. Check it out at your library if you must."
1,REad most of the book while visiting my brother in Alaska. Loved it. I am going to be making my sourdough starter soon. Book is full of great stories and recipes.
1,"This book is worth to keep in your collection as it does not only advise what to do with sourdough but Ruth also told you what the picture of past 100 years ago in Alaska where no stand mixer nor any civilized stuffs in kitchen, just a pot of sourdough."
1,"got this for my daughter in NC, she is now making prefect bread. Wish she lived closer to make me some"
1,"One of these 26 songs played as background music on a YouTube video of some kind of gymnastic or dance feat out of Russia. I hunted down the melody, read the English lyrics, then decided to see what else was in the album. Downloaded the full album for $15 via Amazon mp3 downloader, and now happily listen to the melodies (interspersed) on my iPod."
1,"My experience: I got this from FM, not Amazon. The DVD player rattled pretty loudly sometimes (but not always) when I put in a DVD. I tried several. The picture quality wasn't all that great and the screen got a horizontal line thru the middle after a short time that would not go away. Plus one of the other reviewers was dead on about the remote - the layout makes no sense at all! Very poor human engineering, IMO. I brought it back to the store for a refund. I saw the same model under the Emerson name for <$400 at WM but was hesitant to buy it."
1,"Light weight, space saving very attractive design. Sharp Picture, Good sound quality and quick response time. DVD playback also excellent. Only negative is its remote control. It is hard to read the functions of the keys due to color choices. The placement of the keys are almost illogical and you have to look at it carefully before each use. It almost seems like it was designed by an imbecil. The quality, the features and the price still makes this TV an excellent buy."
1,"I bought this for my wife for her birthday,and had toreturn it because the DVD palyer would not work. I returned it and got a repalcement, which once again the DVD player failed to work! It is a piece of junk."
1,"This TV is set so that it is not capable of a ""recall"" function. If you want to flash back between channels, this TV is not going to give it to you. The remote control that comes with the TV has no recall function, so I bought a Sony universal, which is a much better remote, that had the recall button on it. However, I soon learned that the TV is set at the factory to not have the capability to flash-back. It may not be a big deal to some, but this user found it very annoying."
1,"I bought this to replace a 13"" tube tv in my kitchen. What I gained was a larger screen plus relcaiming the counter space. The picture is good, and the internal DVD player is a bonus. All in all, a good purchase."
1,"The first one I bought was defective. The DVD didn't work at all. I purchased it from Electronics Express and when I contacted them they were wonderful. They gave me an RMA number right away, Fedex picked it up the next day and a new one arrived 1 week later. This one is just fine. I really love the clarity of the picture. My only complaint is that in DVD mode, the sound isn't loud enough. I have it in my RV and with the A/C running, I can barely hear it. I solved the problem by running an audio out jack from the TV to the input on the RV stereo speaker system. It's very lightweight and easy to move around and store. A bonus for the RV. The remote isn't great, but it works just fine and the video/audio jacks and antenna input are easy to get to as is the DVD player. All in all, it's a great deal for the price."
1,"This book in my opinion is biased and takes an angle of Europe that is ""clean and proper"" and fails to shed light on the rest of it. I can understand that these are ""tourist guides"" and why would anyone want to tour a country forgotten by time. However, I am a very disappointed Romanian with this book and would never use it as my reference. I have seen travel guides outlining Europe exclude Romania before, but with the precision and detail of DK's series, I was left yet again in disappointment."
1,"This book is realy great for everybody who likes to travel Europe. The combination of good pictures, illustration and texts is perfect. You get a good overall view for the most important sights, places, cities and countries in Europe and also a bit of historical information. As a European who already traveled a bit I still could find a lot of inspiration to more interesting places to go. Thank a lot to Eyewitness Travel for there great books!"
1,"I bought both this and lonely planet and have used lonely planet more because this book is full of pictures but doesn't give you all the info you need. Also, I ended up buying each indiv city guide as well because this one only scratches the surface!"
1,I bought this book because we are moving to Germany and I wanted to get a good overview of all the countries in Europe that we could travel too. Unfortunately pages 457-480 on Greece are not in English - looks to be Spanish. There was some sort of printing problem! But I found the rest of the book to give good highlights of the countries.
1,"From Memphis, TN. comes The Reatards, fronted, of course, by wild kid Jay Reatard. He starting off on Eric Oblivians label, Goner, at the tender age of 15. Jay, now 19, is still rocking and offending the sensibilities of his community. Overdriven, loud, crackling guitars underlaying Jay's southern crooning howl energizes some of the most amazing hate-filled song writing we've heard in years."
1,"Either 1 or 5 Stars. Depends on how you look at it.1 Star because they sent 6 feet of 2"" OD copper pipe.0 Star because they won't accept returns on it.5 stars because I figure it's actually worth $12-15/foot and since they won't take a return I figure I can sell it and make $40-50 on this deal"
1,"Thia was a gift for my Husband, who loved the book. It arrived on the date we were told it would."
1,"The text is the same as ever (I think), but the plates are markedly inferior to all previous editions. Had I known this ahead of time, I would not have purchased this volume."
1,"An extremely helpful gem on a complex subject of second century religious authority and textual use. For anyone serious about this period and the interelation of cultures, this book is essential. Is it complex and detailed? Of course, it must be to argue the point. Should you buy it? Yes, unless you want to keep running back to the library. I write this only after thoroughly disagreeing with the review above."
1,"The screen arrived in a cardboard box that was pretty beat up. The screen itself is very lightweight, very cheesy looking. The ""finish"" was worn across the entire top of the screen. I knew this wasn't solid brass, but I expected something that at least looked decent from a distance for the price I paid."
1,"Purchased this screen last week and it came with noticeable scrapes across the top. The box it came in was gigantic with plenty of packaging material, but the screen was packaged loosely at the bottom. However, since it was in another smaller box, I'm thinking that the scraping was there to begin with, and not from shipping. Still deciding whether to go through the trouble of exchanging it since another reviewer said they had the same damage. I wouldn't want to risk getting another with the same damage and I really need a screen right now. Other than the damage, it's a very nice screen."
1,"You don't expect music from africa to be so profesionally produced. Me from the white world, don't understand the lyrics, but we do understand the music which is a mixture between salsa, soukous and fado with always the african feeling for rithem. The soft almost borred voice of Oliver N'goma fits pefectly in the music. The CD is recorded in France Paris, you can hear that professionals have been working on the CD. A must for a hot, lazy night.greetings Arno, Amsterdam"
1,"I ordered these shoes to replace the previous pair that had ripped apart at the sole. Clark said they did not make this shoe anymore, so I had to order them through Amazon. Sadly, the second pair ripped in the same place within 3 months. My son has since bought a similar pair from Sperry and they seem to be holding up much better."
1,"The narrative style of this work by famous founders' biographer John Morse is arrogant, flippant and frequently exaggerated. It carries the tone of the amateur Yankee historian on high, passing judgment on this Southern statesman who was neither from Boston nor a Harvard graduate. Perhaps considered penetrating for its day, it really represents nothing more than opinion today. The research is so thin that one must conclude that Morse wrote the entire manuscript essentially from memory, with little reference to the primary and secondary sources we expect of historians now. If it weren't for the fact that Morse wrote this piece 110 years ago, I'd have rated it only one star."
1,"This was a gift for my 6 yr old daughter. She is a big Barbie fan as well as loves to use the computer. She is still enjoying this game. She completed it in a few hours which worried me at first, but she loves to do it over and over again. The music is enjoyable and the colors are vibrant. It seems to be very user friendly also....my daughter has not really needed my help to use it once she started it the first time."
1,"My four year old daughter loves everything Barbie and loves the Rapunzel movie. This game is tons of fun, even for a 42 year old. We love playing it together. We love decorating all the rooms and finding the gems. What even better is, she can play it alone and I get some me time!"
1,My 4 year old daughter has been addicted to this game. She plays it over and over again. She loves the opening song and has been singing it non stop. She gets excited each time she completes a room and finds a gem and loves solving the maze to find Prince Stefan. The only problem is that she sings the song so much I can't get it out of my head!
1,This is such a great game both my 3 year old son and 7 year old daughter love it. I like to play to if they would let me! So much fun decorating the rooms and so many choices to keep you playing Great game. Not at all what you would think a Barbie game would be. Great fun for all!!
1,"... My daughter and I loved the movie. She is 5 years old and it took her 2 hours to complete the game. Absolutely no challenge, and very little interaction. It is essentially just clicking on the screen to make it play the 7 or 8 scenes it has programmed. There are no games to play, nothing to figure out, nothing to do. Save your money."
1,"My 6-year old daughter is currently sobbing in her bedroom as a result of this rotten game.She spent an hour on this game painting in pretty pictures and coloring in flowers. But halfway through the game, the program hung, and wouldn't let us leave the room or click anywhere else. Now even if we exit the game and then start it back up, we are frozen in one spot while Barbie's disembodied voice urges us to ""explore somewhere else in the castle.""Standard software troubleshooting and rebooting didn't help. Vivendi Games' support site is ""currently disabled."" And now I'm left with a weeping, frustrating child who doesn't understand that it is not her fault that her game won't work. I'm hoping it was just incompetent software programming that couldn't catch the bug my 6-year old caught the first time around. Or maybe they just don't care about the problems, so long as you get our 20 bucks. If you don't want a crying little girl, avoid this game!"
1,"I purchased this software for my 5 year old granddaughter and she loves playing it so much. She lets me play it sometimes, but she doesn't always like what I come up with. I plan to purchase other software programs for her."
1,"My 3 year old daughter & I both love this software. We actually fight over who is going paint the pictures or choose the themes for each room. This game allows you to be creative & use your imagination by ""decorating"" each room of the castle and finding the missing gems to the prince's crown which gives Rapunzel the power to find Prince Stephan who has been turned to stone & bring him back to life. The music & animation is the best I have seen. Most of the kids software that I've seen is boring to me as an adult, but this is not at all. I sometimes like to play it without her! There are so many variations on color schemes & patterns & that you can never be bored. I highly recommend this for girls of all ages."
1,"This game is pretty exciting and it is very nice and it is really creative and one of a kind. The only bad thing is that there is only one ""castle"" for the kids to ""decorate"" and once you are done with the whole castle that is basically it. You either have to create a new username for yourself to do it all over again or you get another game like I did. My sister finished the ""castle"" in about 2 hours and after that has never even looked at this game anymore. It is a nice game and it is fun but it is not really worth that much money."
1,"NEGATIVE: This game does not work with OS X and requires the CD so you can't have it on multiple computers. It is slow I have to tell my daughter that it is thinking a lot, this is because it has to access the CD everytime there is a new task. You can't view the openning sequence again without throwing out the saved game files. Some of the tasks and controls are too hard and not user friendly even for adults.it CRASHES all the time.Mouse is jumpy and hard to use.POSITIVE: Some tasks are easy, possible to use, grand and beautiful.My three year has enough patience to survive the multiple trials to get this to work."
1,"I ordered this DVD and received a substitute I never received the DVD I ordered from Importcds (the Vendor). I contacted them and did not recieve any feedback. I can't rate a DVD I have never seen. I didn't bother to send it back because it would have cost me more that I orginally paid for it. In the future I will watch for the name of the person and/or persons I am buying from. I thought they were a good company. I understand a simple mistake but, to not get a response at all is not good businees sense. I spend hundreds of dollars a month on Amazon.com building my DVD collection. I guess I will be more careful in the future."
1,"This is my second bottle of sheer freesia, I just love this fragrance, its a light delicate sent, beautiful, like a summer day."
1,This perfume is just AWFUL! Smells nothing like freesia.The gift recipient was not impressed. The worst is that it can't be returned!
1,"Wow, what people will do behind jealousy and revenge - there are some doors you should not open, and if you do - be prepared for what you find behind it!"
1,"While the movie in itself was better than i expected what i didnt expect was the ""non existent"" Thai soundtrack. While the option was on the disc menu (as well as stated on the package) the Thai soundtrack does not exist. No matter what you choose, Thai or English, English is what you get and while there are some exceptions most dubbing is ridiculous at best and the dubbing on this title is sub par. While this review covers only the first movie of the two the other may remain in plastic never to see the inside of my dvd player. Its a shame and a sham when you purchase what claims to be original and is not. Very disapointed in this offering from Tokyo Shock."
1,"Man, some more jammin tracks from the SUC. This is Pokey's first official record....and sh** is sooo real. Love the production, everything is real nice & screwed out. This is among the last of the great SUC records. Not to say they've fallen off....just they've downsized so much with the deaths of the screw pioneers. Sad but true. If ya love Tx rap, you've gotta get this 1. Somethin to kickback & blow big too, somethin to jam in the ride. So underrated, right here. I wish people would forget all the bullsh** on BET/MTV and check what's happening in Houston. But i guess...it's sadly almost too late. Pat's gone, hawk's gone...screw, Moe, Pimp C, Big Steve. Makes me sad. Regardless, Pokey is still alive and making new music, keeping the legacy alive. And this is a great place to start with him. Classic record. Love it, man"
1,"This is probably the best southside CD to ever come out. Pretty much every song has a guest or 2 on the track. From the late Fat Pat, to Botany Boys, Mr. 3-2, Big Steve, Chris Ward, H.A.W.K, and many more. This is how a southside CD should always be."
1,"Well written chronicles of The Farm from the people who lived it. Excellent photos as well.I kept looking for a photo of me and my then-wife, but I wasn't there long enough. But shewas :-)"
1,i have a copy of this book and love it and can't wait til the revised version comes out in a few weeks
1,"Bill Harvey has a wonderful gift of making history come alive in this book. This book awakens a sense of wonder at the possiblility of a real relationship with God as you follow the faithfulness of one little girl in ancient times. Young girls ages 5-15 will love this book. It has always been one of my most loved treasures, a real Keeper !"
1,This book drew air pretty bad. I have no idea why someone would waste their time writing it. Boy did it draw air. Do not read this book.
1,"just like the title says. Warm, comfy but run a size too big. I don't wear them out as they are just for lounging, so it's not that big of a deal for me."
1,"I ordered the cake topper June 27, 2010. I was given an estimated shipping date of July 1-7, 2010. Those dates came & went with no cake topper. I contacted the seller twice with no response. I filed a claim with Amazon. I did end up receiving a cake topper on July 16, 2010; however, it's not even the one I ordered! The seller did refund my money, but has never contacted me or apologized for the mishap. I will never buy anything from the seller again. I looked at the seller's feedback & I'm not the only person they have done wrong, so buyer beware!!"
1,Arrived very quickly and it is a cute topper however I wouldn't have bought it if they didn't provide instructions!!!! I should have listened to the other reviews.... If you are hoping to get more than the topper DO NOT BUY THIS!! So annoyed I have this Ariel and have no idea how to decorate the cake.
1,"Promised with this item are ""Complete Instructions"" and the additional pledge that ""Sweet Graces will email you with the Supply List and Instruction sheets on purchase - so you can be ready ahead of time!"" I received none of this - only a plastic figurine and bracelet. To boot, Amazon claims they can do nothing to help me contact the seller. All I got was a phone number for the manufacturer. Let's hope that yields some results. Meanwhile, I'm wishing I had listened to previous feedback about this unreliable seller :/"
1,"I just don't get it - SOULWAX has been around since the 90s, when they released their ""rock"" debut (on the now defunct Almo Sounds), chock full of should-have-been radio hits, and then when while they got some attention for their ""2 Many DJs"" mash-up/remix bootlegs, when they return to a full-fledged band, as with last year's ANY MINUTE NOW, critcs & consumers alike barely took notice of that album's amazing writing, production, and sheer electro-rock power. Hopefully, ""Nite Versions"" (a cheeky title recalling when 80s bands like Duran Duran used to release ""Nite Version"" on 12"" of singles for clubs) will garner more sales and attention for SOULWAX - the songs practically leap out of the speakers to grab your neck and turn you head and make you move. Can't wait to hear what they do TIGA on his upcoming ""Sexor"" debut...?"
1,"wow - this is like the most amazing album ever. Every track so rocks...specially1) E-talking2) NyLipps3) I love Techo.great job guysMusicChoice played their whole album this Saturday night..and I was jamming to it the whole time going ""wow"".one more thing, if you're not into House/Techno/electronic then you don't want none of this, cause you won't feel it."
1,"2 stars of 5 for this slow dull ""classical"" 1980's style movie. This movie has a young Jason Bateman in the lead. Very very very slow and dull with a few moments of bad 1980's style music. To our relief the background music (which is very annoying) is kept to a minimum. Though it attempts to be an action/suspense movie, it achieves neither. I'd suggest skipping this movie."
1,"I loved this movie as a kid and I am so happy the powers that be have decided to release it finally! If you want to see a great 80's movie, this is it!"
1,The book was wriiten very horribly. I would never in my life recommend such a book. The stories lacked any mystery to them and did not leave me wanting to figure out who the culprit was. The only good thing was that none of the stories took up ten or twelve pages.
1,"Trains, shapes and pegs - a winning combination, guaranteed to make both the child and the parent happy. Good starter puzzle for the 1 yr old range."
1,"I remember getting this book so faintly that that says alot about my opinion of it. Basically, while I will entertain lots of odd ideas and theories, this book was basically silly."
1,"I think that the Deodato concerts are very rich, as he used real strings and band musicians, as well as you can appreciate the John Tropea excelent renditions on guitar."
1,"These tracks are not the ""original"" versions but are re-recorded versions. So, whether the tracks are ""remastered"" or not is irrelevant."
1,Book shipped quickly and was in excellent condition as stated. Easy transaction would buy again
1,"This is an engaging a count of life of Tess a girl who at a young age washed up on the shore of the Isle of May. With no memory of the life before then, she stays with the old caretakers of the isle. After the caretakers are dead a young man, Colin Macpherson washes up on shore. Colin takes Tess back with her to his castle where he helps her uncover her past. They are opposites,but you know what they say opposites attract. This book is just one of many in the Avon True Romance series. I have read every book in the series and I know that if you like this book you love the rest. This is a great book for girls about 10 to 16 because it is still a romance novel, but not what you call a trashy romance novel. It is a great novel fokr those who are just getting into romance novels."
1,"When I got this book, I wasn't expecting much, but man was I wrong! I loved this book! Now I may not usually be tied in by a man with long blond hair wearing a kilt, but the authors really made Colin into this enchanting Highlander. Tess is a very soft heroine. While she sometimes seems too guillible, I have to remember that it is part of the story. This is one of my favorite books in the series."
1,"Tess Lindsay is content to be the sole occupant of a remote island but when Colin Macpherson washes ashore her life of solitude gets shaken up. Tess had always been told to fear strange men but she reluctantly strikes up a friendship with Colin. Soon Tess discovers that she has a family she had forgotten about but will she have the courage to leave the island and start a new life?The beginning of this book is very amusing and the end is decent too but the middle is a big problem. The plot loses much of it's believability mostly due to the poor characterization. All of the new characters that are introduced are one sided and their behavior lacks reason. Even Tess and Colin's development is side tracked in much the same way and their relationship seems awkward and forced. The writing does improve towards the end but it's not enough to save the book. Unless you have your heart set on reading all of the books in the series, skip this one."
1,"I am disappointed in its performance. It seems underpowered and is constantly trying to read CDs, half the time unsuccessfully. I am going to try to return it to Amazon."
1,"These pants were way too big (looked about 2 sizes larger), and they were incredibly stiff. They would have been very uncomfortable for my daughter to wear all day."
1,"This is my first encounter with Yoruba and I have to say that CDs are really helping. However, the book is very short and not particular about certain aspects and details of grammar and other nuances - for someone who NEVER spoke Yoruba and doesn't have anybody to ask for a clue, it leaves a lot of questions unanswered - for this, however, there are hopefully other Yoruba textbooks.On the brighter note, I would like to add that the book does a very good job in giving a little insight on Yoruba people and Yoruba culture in general. I would recommend it as a good start book for anyone who wants to learn Yoruba - you can't go wrong with it."
1,"I agree, the CDs are a much needed help, since it would be impossible to pronnounce the Yoruba tones without the help of a native speaker. However, the design of the book is really poor and confusing. I have found several spealling mistakes in English and Yoruba. And the grammar explanations are very hard to understand.Unfortunately there are not many Teach Yourself Yoruba books that are worth it. This one at least provides basic vocabulary and pronounciation skills."
1,"I ordered this DashMat for a specific vehicle, it was not the correct mat. I returned the original one and they sent me an exact duplicate of the wrong mat. I can't seem to get the correct one and therefore it sits in a box!!!!!!"
1,I play this with my grandchildren. It teaches us both the value of a good memory and is challenging for all. You sometimes miss the most obvious. Lots of fun--tic tac toe with a twist!
1,"My 4 year old daughter LOVES this game. She sings the ""Strike Up The Band and Clap Your Hands for Kelly's Pet Parade!"" song around the house. She can dress the Kelly kids, ""train"" each pet (teach the pony to jump, etc.), clean and get the animals ready for the parade (paint the elephant's toe nails, etc.), and decorate the floats...all by herself. She'll get everything ready (showing me everything she has accomplished along the way) and then we'll watch her special parade. A wonderfully cute game that I highly recommend.She can mostly do the entire game on her own. I have it installed on a laptop so she is actually using the inset mouse and can still do the game. The only one she has a tough time with is the Polar Bear catching fish game. It's tricky to move your finger on the mouse pad and click at the same time to catch the fish. It would be much easier using a regular mouse."
1,My 6-year old and 5-year old both really enjoy this game. Has lots to do with several different animals to prepare for the parade. You get to design a float and it just endless fun! Graphics and animation are very colorful and cute. It's a winner!
1,fun easy game if you can keep it from freezing. I've reinstalled it and done everything I know to do to correct the issue. It's a shame my 4yr old really likes it.
1,"We purchased this game a year ago and my girls still love to play it. Lot's of activities, they love to decorate the floats and watch the parade."
1,i am completely satisfied in the manner my order was delivered.the shoes are just as awesome as the advertisement showed them to be.
1,"This cd is really great.BUT ITS NOT A GAME!they're not long versons though, only 90 odd seconds each.If that Claire, also from the UK (who was disappointed with the cd) wants to get in touch, i know where you can get games with the songs you want.I'm assuming you're after all the cool songs from euromix.If so, they are on 2nd and 3rd mix games from japan.but there are also US versions available too."
1,i have ordered this cd of here but it will take abit to get to me as i live in England. But i have danced and sang along to it at the arcades ive been to and i think its great if you love to dance. My favorite songs are what a feeling and in the navey!! i also like captain jack but i love them all..
1,"I did not know this was the audio cd of the game, I thought it could be used on the playstation. Maybe the other guys are from the US or somewhere where it is actually easy to get the game,and play it,but this was all in japanese and was not compatible with my machine. I am deeply disappointed as i love the arcade game, but the Dance stage euromix (Dance Dance Revolution equivalent) is lacking in decent tracks, many are jungle-y and are difficult to dance to them. Also, most of these tracks are unheard of here and are therefore not very enjoyable. However, my favourite are Keep on moving, make a Jam, and Video Killed the Radio star. But it gets a bit pedantic if you keep playing on these tracks. If anyone is in the same situation as I am, or those of you who are lucky enough the play on the newest version, can you please let me know where I can order one? I am in dance deprivation/boredom!"

1,"I admit that I bought this album for the title track alone. After all, had that been the only good track on this CD I still would have felt that it was worth my money.But the title track is just the beginning for this fine country offering by John Michael Montgomery. I found myself listening to and enjoying every track on LETTERS FROM HOME. Montgomery's smoother-than-silk voice is one of the finest in country music today and his straight-forward approach to his music comes through in every note. You won't want to miss this one.THE HORSEMAN"
1,"JMM has never released a bad album. Many would say this is a comeback album but every couple of years he releases an album with great hits. For some reason, radio hasn't played some of his great songs from his latest albums. ""Goes Good With Beer"" and ""Little Devil"" would be great singles to spice up country radio. ""Letters From Home"" deserves to be single of the year and ""Cool"" is not far behind. The more I listen to the album, the more I love it."
1,i like letters from home cuz it tells a story that if you really listen you can acctually hear john michael montgomery tell his story of soldiers and all that stuffi liked it and i like punk rock and rock so it must be good if i like it
1,I gave it 5 stars because my little dog had so much fun riping it apart but only took him 24 hrs to do it buy that is 23 hrs longer than other balls
1,"LO QUE PENSE QUE NO ME INTERESABA SABER SOBRE EL BOX Y SUS CAMPEONES...PERO ME CAUTIVO Y LO LEI HASTA EL FINAL !AHORA SI PUEDO DISCUTIR DE BOX CON MI ESPOSO Y MIS CU√ëADOS...¬°Y HASTA CON MI SUEGRO, QUE ES EX BOXEADOR !"
1,"This cereal is so sweet....yet so good for you! One taste=ADDICTION!!!! I just tried this cereal out of curiousity and I was hooked! It is an excellent breakfast choice, or just any time to eat! Especially as breakfast because you will crave more honey taste and you won't be hungry later {probably because of how much you'd eat} and it is actually sweeter and better than Honey Bunches of Oats. Cap'n Crunch Berries is an option, but this splendid cereal is SO FILLED WITH A HONEY-FILLED TASTE! I have not tried much better tasting cereal than this! Oh!"
1,"This cereal is great because it tastes so good. You just crave it. But a word of warning: read the label. Last time my husband and I looked, it had saturated fat! All the other cereals in our cabinet did not... hmmmm. Another reviewer noticed this problem too!Also, Amazon's price of $23 is outrageous. It is between $1.99 to $2.50 in our stores."
1,"I was really distraught to go to my local Walmart and see that they stopped carrying my favorite cereal. But as was elated to find that ""the site who has everything including a church"" made it available to me by the 6-pack. Oh's is an amazing cereal. The one thing i dont like is the box is so small. I get maybe 3 bowls out of the entire box:-(."
1,My husband loves this book. He said he has learned so much and that this was the best book to learn how to build a timber frame house by.
1,this book is a great over view of the joints used in building but has no information on beam spans or loads to actually build a building
1,My friend is a master carpenter and he saw this book at a recent trip to Hanford Mills museum.He is an avid reader and loved the book so much that I am inclined to read it as well!! Enjoy.
1,This book vaguely breezed across history and went into various types of timber structures. The mortise and tenon joints that were illustrated were fascinating but not practical for a home builder.
1,"My wife and I built a hybrid timber frame home using this book as a guide. Although we have construction skills, this book was invaluable in guiding us through the process. We can't wait to build another. We highly recommend this book to anyone considering a timber frame house."
1,"Yet another example of an superb book done a serious disservice by e-book publishers.Multiple spelling errors, improperly placed figures & captions, whole sections of the book written in CAPS for some reason.If you are looking for an excellent reference on traditional timber framing, look no further, but please pick up the print version instead of the e-book."
1,"If you are expecting a book full of glossy sharp pictures, this is not the one to buy.A lot of drawings and BW pictures that inform what they need to. This is a very good manual for those who want to venture in a timber frame project."
1,"These wraps were not doing anything when we placed them in ""hot"" water. We searched the internet and found others having the same problem. The instructions are very poor. First off, you need to dip in boiling water (or at least some temperature level above what I would call hot). Second, the instructions don't describe what should happen, should the image shrink around the egg, transfer to it -- what?Needless to say, it was frustrating for a minute or two, but my wife - who is very intelligent and great in the kitchen - immediately thought, ""well... hot water wouldn't do much to change the properties of the plastic, so let's try boiling water - nothing to lose.""Should be more explicit in the instructions. (We were using the star wars version of this product)."
1,2006 Coast to Coast for PC is great! The graphics are awesome... The game is what I had hoped for and a lot more!!
1,"Outrun was the biggest disappointment of my holidays.If you've just come home from a life in 1985 you might enjoy this. I read the reviews before buying but it didn't sink in what Arcade style meant. I am an addicted follower of Colin MacRea rally and thought to race a ferrari across the US would be cool. I was wrong. The games is to car racing what space invaders is to ""Battlefield"". The landscape moves instead of the car and you have these idiotic stages like impress your girlfriend with how many slides you can do. Total rubbish. Not anyones fault but mine, but I live in Ireland and got it shipped through Florida so it is a costly mistake."
1,"I had Henry back in the 70's. I don't remember him with a nose since it was chewed off, but he was well loved. He's long gone and I thought I was the only one who ever had a Henry since nobody knew what I was talking about. I can't believe I've found him again!! Nobody can replace my original worn Henry, but I'm so excited to have his clone back!!"
1,I had Henry back in the early 70's. I am forty now and still have my original. I bought a new one for my Dad who is ill because I knew he would get the significance. Henry got me through the insecurities I had as a child and I am hoping he does the same for my Dad as he battles terminal cancer.Thanks for making him again.
1,"What it is about ""Henry Dog"". My daughter was 6 when we gave her Henry. Love is not the word. Obsession! A few years later my ex-wife decided he had to go. Under the guise of an ""incurable"" lice infection my ex-wife threw him out. Trauma followed. We bought a replacement which my daughter has safely on her closet shelf. He is thread bare. I found him online and was overwhelmed to read the reviews at Amazon.com. None had less than 5 stars. Each story told how this little guy had touched their lives. These Henry owners, both girls and boys, cherished him as if he had been a ""real"" dog. I guess to them, he is. Daddy had to buy his little (40 year old) daughter a new one. I got both the 14"" and 3"". I was on the phone when she opened the box..... Henry was home again. My granddaughter saw Henry got excited and wanted one also. She is 19 years old. This company should bottle ""Henry Dog`s"" charisma. Thanks for keeping him alive."
1,"I had two Henry Dogs. One I lost in a ride at Walt Disney World, the second to replace it. I have no idea where Henry got to. But now that I found ""him"", I will have my friend again. I had this toy from the time I was six years old, almost 40 years ago, and I think I'll be seeing him again around Christmas time. It's a sweeet toy and really good for children of *all* ages!"
1,"While this book is a take-off on the classic Snow White, it's a fairytale for grown ups with some class act characters and a rich and rewarding love story. I thoroughly enjoyed reading it, and look forward to more of Ms. Sinclair's works."
1,"Although I was excited to purchase this book, my excitement didn't last when I looked at the sketches / pictures in the book. I call them pictures because that is what they truly are, not actual patterns. Norma Gregory's talent shows up well in her designs but due to their complicated rendering they are very difficult to transfer.This book is not for beginners - but more seasoned artisans.If you are looking for patterns, like I was, you will be disappointed in this book."
1,my brother in law was thrilled with the clarity and instructional commentswill be looking for more titles by her
1,"Unless they sent me the wrong product by mistake, the foot cushion picture and description does not match the item delivered. I was under the impression I would receive two (a pair) of water filled foot cushions that I could insert into my shoes. Instead I received ONE foot cushion, filled with another material (not water) that you attach to your foot via a toe strap. I was definately not happy with the item and sent it back for a refund. Luckily for me Amazon has a great return policy... they make returns very easy!"
1,"I heard about this book, so I wanted to read it to see if it was as funny and stupid (unintentionally) as I heard.I was not disappointed. Few things in life are free, and sex is defintely not among them.The perfect coda to this book is that the couple got divroced several years after publishing this book. You can't make this stuff up."
1,"This Broadway Theatre Archive production took one of the wittiest, most sparkling 18th-century comedies--and ruined it. The costumes are intentionally absurd (think Beach Blanket Babylon), the acting is way over-the-top-camp, and the incidental music could not be worse. The music, BTW, is a combination of pop Renaissance and pop modern; anything but 18th century. The director appears to have had the goal of showing that his company was just too hip and too modern to do anything but make fun of this silly, fusty old play.I like ""The School for Scandal"" very much, and not having found any other DVDs of it, I started out with the intention of keeping a recording of even a bad production. But when they got into the extended bop-be-bop of the drinking song scene, I knew I just couldn't ever sit through this one again.The visuals are also blurry, but with the production being so bad, so what? Anyone who actually likes this play will be revolted by this DVD."
1,"I first tried buying this tape from a Marketplace seller. I sent it back because the tape quality was poor and the packaging looked unprofessional. After returning it I bought one from Amazon proper and . . . it was the same quality tape and the same packaging. Since I'm now sure this is not a bootleg tape, all I can say is . . . some videos are better than others."
1,"Classic drawing room comedy, period piece. Cleverly written in a time when the audience needed a bit of a nudge to figure out each character. Each person's name describes how you should feel about each! Charming idea from the 1700's. If you've never had a chance to see one of these comedies, take a look. This is a famous play and well done. Must see for theatre students."
1,"This CD compilation set was purchased for me. I love the 80s, and they chose great songs. The songs are not performed by the original artists. Instead, they're poorly covered by ""the Starlite Singers""."
1,"I should have read the prior reviews of this record before buying it. Although it appears to be a collection of new wave singles from the 80s, these are just cover versions sung by the ""Starlite Singers"". The description of the record says that it is by ""various artists"" implying that they are by the original artists, but this is not true. Total garbage. The one bright spot is that I got a prompt refund when I returned it."
1,"I bought this set last November and just now decided to listen to the CDs. Nowhere in the description on Amazon does it say not the original artists! In fact, it says various artists, which is deceiving because only one group performs all the songs. It leads one to believe original artists when it says various artists because it is, after all, a compilation of music by various artists! Duh! So, don't waste your money. I will probably throw these in the trash as I'm a purist and I want original, not wedding reception music!"
1,"This is one of those cheesy compilations where they find session bands and similar sounding artists to sing the songs. These are NOT ORIGINAL SONGS BY THE ARTISTS. If you loved K-TEL CD's and don't care about hearing the artists originals, and don't care about cheap sounding synthesizers playing the music or that fact that some of the vocalists are pretty bad, then you might like this cd. But if you are a fan of the 80's and the amazing music it produced, then buy other collections and don't waste your money on this schlock!!!!"
1,Performance is outstanding. I had a previous Sony 8 mm Handycam which died and I replaced it with this camera so I could continue to playback my old 8 mm tapes. This camera performs faster and is simpler to use than my old Sony. It does everything I need and does it well... I got a great deal.
1,Bought this camera for Christmas. Had her open it first so she could film the nights party & NO TAPES ARE INCLUDED! Of course all stores are closed Christmas day so the thing is USELESS until the day after. Shame on Sony. How much would a tape included in the packace cost them ? Not included Battery chargers are ....
1,"Although all of Mr Hines work is high quality, Waving Not Drowning (for me) is the highlight of the 3 A&M projects. The song ""Curious Kind"" is simply a masterpiece!The remastering is of the quality you have come to expect from one of Rock's greatest producers, song writers, and performers.GET IT!"
1,"This book never really seems to get going. There is too much time spent in the courtroom while basic questions about the crime and the suspect/defendant are left unasked.After 200 pages, I realized that this book wasn't going to pick up or reveal any crucial information to make sense out of things until the very end.As a result, the whole story rapped up very quickly in an unbelievable way and you are left wondering why no one could figure anything out earlier. Based on the ending, the detectives and attorneys appear rather incompetent.I did enjoy parts of the book, however, and I think the plot needs to be unfolded at a different rate (not so slow in the beginning and not so fast at the end). I am a McBain fan and think that some of his other books are better written."
1,"I knew there was something missing from the first book when I read it, because it didn't match what I heard her say years ago when she came to my church to speak. Now I know, the abuse was so difficult for her to talk about even when she wrote a book about it. Later, with the help of a trusted friend, she was able to tell the most difficult and abusive parts of her childhood experience. This what the second book is about. The most wonderful thing about Dorie, is that she is able to forgive her abusers and move on with her life. She is still able to have a successful and happy life, in spite of the horrendous abuse of her childhood. This is what so many women need to hear. With the Lord's help, it is possible!"
1,"I didn't refer to Baseball America as such. It was Cardinals GM Walt Jocketty who said it. And who am I to contradict? The best columnists in the game, from Peter Gammons, Tracy Ringolsby and Jayson Stark, to detailed information in ALL of baseball, from the Major Leagues to Japan, stats, scores, and the best and most extensive resource on prospect information, there's not a single serious fan in all of baseball who deserves such a title if is not a Baseball America subscriber. You got to read it if you want to know the stars of tomorrow (being tomorrow 6 years or 2 months). Top 10 prospects from every team till its massive Top 100 list, Baseball America covers it all. I know, I have been subscribed for 2 years now, and I can't think of living without it!"
1,"I have read Baseball America off and on over the years and finally took the plunge and got a subscription. This is the best place to get coverage of the minors, college, and high school baseball so you know about the top prospects before others do."
1,"An embarassment. Steer clear of this one folks. Just when you thought these guys were the last real ""fusion"" types about...Since when did the last great secret of the fusion world start taking pointers from Joe Satriani and listening to old Al DiMeola pratice sessions? Where the hell is Phil when you need him, oh yes, Tarzan. The star is for the Bruford and Wilding/Bonus tracks, and well does one really want those?"
1,"I read ""Trouble on Titan"" around 1970, when the Apollo program was at its apex, and the human exploration of the Solar System seemed only a short step away. My review is based on old memories, but I can still remember a mining colony on Titan and jet craft using oxygen for fuel and burning Titan's methane atmosphere. We've learned much since this book was written, and Titan's atmosphere has less methane than we originally thought. However, this book was well written, and I am sure will intrigue my son as much as it intrigued his father, who is now working at NASA on the Cassini/Huygens mission to Saturn and Titan. This book has that old-style sci-fi flavor that made another world seem more like reality than fantasy. I think if you enjoyed the Lucky Starr and David Starr stories by Asimov, you will enjoy ""Trouble on Titan."""
1,"We got these as a gift for our one year old. He loves them! He tries very hard to get all the little things out of the blocks - and obviously fails. He loves that some of them move, some of them jiggle, some of them make noise - its almost an adventure!The three year old also loves them because they incorporate the alphabet and he can easily identify the items inside: B - Banana, P - Penguin, U - Umbrella, Z - Zebra.Bonus - when the 1 y/o gets frustrated because he can't pry the items out of the block no matter how hard he tries, he usually flings them. The 3 y/o tends to use them to build walls or towers for the sole purpose of smashing another toy into them, or dropping them off high places. And I've stepped on two of them already. They seem to tolerate this treatment rather well."
1,"These Alphabet blocks are so beautiful they could be classed as works of art or collectors items. I have purchased two seys as gifts and will probably buy more,"
1,"I purchased the Alphabet blocks for my twin daughters. They are just over 8 months old and they love them. This product is a great learning tool for them for years to come but for now it a great teething toy!!! I would recommend this to anyone, plus I love Fisher Price."
1,"We got these after seeing the Incrediblocks in the FP Catalog.There are little to no pizazz to the blocks. Some have features where you can ""spin"" them (like the letter Q - Queen) or the W (watermelon seeds that rattle) - but most are just a ""look at me"" type of a block.With that in mind - yes I like the product. They're blocks. They're meant for stacking, knocking over and banging - which my son loves (he's had these since he was 6 months). They're better than the plain wooden blocks because they're textured, they have objects inside, letters - lots of opportunities to learn letters, colors, objects, descriptions, etc.For now he's stacking, banging and knocking over. It'll be around for a while until he's ready to learn more words, colors, objects, animals. This review isn't profound or eye openings because again - they're just blocks. Keep that in mind when making your purchasing decision. It will not make your child an overnight rocket scientist =)"
1,"I bought these for two reasons- blocks and educational letters. However, the letters are rubbing off. For the price I paid that was dissapointing. Other than that I love the concept and the objects inside are fun."
1,"Although I felt it looked a bit chinsy, the mother had it on her wish list and was very happy to receive them."
1,"My daughter loves her blocks. She will get them all out and look at each one until she finds her favorite. She likes to shake them and see what each one does. These are cute little blocks that have hours of imaginative playtime inside. They also have blunt corners, so no sharp edges like wood blocks for the safety of smaller children. The fact that they have the letters of the alphabet and a corresponding object inside makes them a great learning tool even for older tots. We have really enjoyed these and recommend them to our friends."
1,"THIS TOY WAS OUR GRANDSON'S FAVORITE, SO I JUST HAD TO FIND IT AGAIN FOR OUR NEWEST GRANDCHILD. THANK GOODNESS FOR ONLINE SHOPPING."
1,"My little boy is just getting interested in these blocks. They are too cute! He's learning to manipulate the block in his hands. The little things inside the blocks are adorable. Some spin, some twirl, some rock. A definate upgrade from the standard wooden blocks."
1,This set incorporates a lot of the favorites from other sets packaged in an A to Z learning format. I have been leary of purchasing too many of these blocks for storage reasons so the zippered case is a great bonus. Definitely worth every penny.
1,These are great blocks but they are definitely not worth the listed $79.99. They can be purchsed for about $20 many other places.
1,"This is a great set of blocks. I researched different blocks for some time and found these to be the most durable, age and developmentally-appropriate, and highly-educational. $25 bucks may seem like a lot, but I think it is well worth it. I am very impressed with the quality.The size and shape of the blocks is just right. My son is 5-months old and he is able to hold the blocks perfectly in his little hands. PLUS, the blocks do not have sharp corners (like the wooden blocks also available on this site) that could hurt your little one (especially those of you with chewers!).One category that I rated this toy with only a 4 (instead of 5) is the ""fun"" factor. For younger babies that may not ""get it"" yet, this toy may not be as fun for them until they are a little bit older. My son is not yet able to fully comprehend that there are even toys inside the blocks, but then again he is only 5 months. Give him a couple of months and he'll really dig them!"
1,"this is not waterproof.its GARBAGE where batteries go in broke,while trying to adj.DO NOT BUY.you turn the end to control it,that loosens the battery cover where water gets in so how is it waterproff?????"
1,"The California Exotics Waterproof Delights Blue Ballsy,is to spice up the relationship and it worked since the beginning,my other half likes it."
1,"It is very small compared to what i thought it would be, but even so it didn't work when we got it"
1,"Whale naturalist and animal communicator Mary Getten goes beyond what other research has achieved in the way of whale study and communication processes: in 1991 she studied the J-Pod, a family of whales off Washington State. Her contention that they use direct telepathic communication between themselves and can do so with humans also makes for fascinating reading.Diane C. DonovanCalifornia Bookwatch"
1,"I purchased these for a Halloween party, and then...like a dummy, I forgot to put them up! Nevertheless, I did hold them up around the house in search of a good place to hang them. They're pretty big and look really cool. I'd say there's a little bit of educational value too, as you can teach your children about the actual pictures they're depicting. Even though I forgot to hang them up, I really liked these scene setters and I'll be using them next year!"
1,"While I believe in discrimination, I certainly can't believe what is in this book. It is an unsubstantiated smear campaign to rally the troups in higher ed to claw again for the preservation of academic freedom- a rally which falls flat."
1,"Molly Myers, in her review of ""My Name is Rachel Corrie,"" describes the ISM as ""an organization dedicated to non-violence."" This is radical left-wing propaganda: ISM offices have regularly been used to hide terrorists and their weapons, ISM ""pacifists"" regularly throw rocks at IDF soldiers, and they're perfectly willing to use violence in order to sabotage the wall intended to keep ""innocent Palestinians"" from murdering Israelis.So please disregard Molly's reviews; they are biased in the extreme."
1,Four pages of the book was missing. It just happened to be the formulas that my husband needed. Fortunately he was able to copy our friends book. But I will hesitate to buy another book like this again.
1,"The official Chrono Trigger OST has 3 discs. This version has some of the major tracks on it, the audio quality is good, but Caveat Emptor (buyer beware) this is a Chinese knock-off.Oh and if you buy the 3 disc version, make sure the cover does not have a green and red logo reading ""FX"", for this is also a counterfeit. The serial numbers on the real soundtrack CDs are PSCN-5021, PSCN-5022, and PSCN-5023."
1,"These are the handful of tracks we hear over and over again. It's far from complete though.Missing such memorable tracks as ""sealed Door"", ""wings across time"" or ""At the Bottom of the Night"".It doesn't have a single battle theme accept the final boss.Hell this doesn't even have Lucca's theme and she's on the cover!Had I seen a track-list beforehand I wouldn't have bought this.I blame my self for not being more curious of the number of CD's.I'm sorry I paid $35 dollars American for this travesty, may Lavos have mercy on my soul.Save your selves(and your money) while you still can!"
1,"I watched this last night. And I don't remember enough of it to give it a indepth review. But it wasn't as bad as people are letting on nor was it as great as people are letting on. If you don't like your killer to be supernatural then don't bother with this. Its about a guy that comes back from the dead. His whole storyline is kinda silly and there are plot holes all over the place. The acting wasn't bad at all, and neither were the deaths. In fact it was kinda gory. But that doesn't make a great movie. The flashbacks were a little confusing as well. I wouldn't watch it again. But its far from the worst movie I've seen."
1,"I initially bought the movie just because Stephen Colletti (who I'm in love with) was one of the leads...and I really didn't expect much from what looks to be a low-budget indie horror flick. But, I really did like it! The lead girl who plays Jennifer (Nikki DeLoach) is really good. I can't believe I've never seen her in anything before? Maybe I have, but I didn't know!?! It was cool to see the guy from Weekend at Bernie's (Terry Kiser)...he is a really good actor. Too bad he was dead the whole time in both movies I saw him in, lol. Anyways, this was a cool movie and I'm glad I got it!"
1,It was good horrifying never a dull moment u can watch and not be bored ir wondering when is a good part coming
1,"I liked the film it has what every horror likes in this type of movie the suspense,mystery,good and bad times,plus a shocking ending that makes you think that there is more to story, and plot was very good Robert."
1,This movie was a horror film thhat displayed an effort to steer clear of typical horror movie dialogue and pacing. There are no blonde girls and the girls that are here don`t trip over the tree roots in the yard. Now a white girl did fall and twist her knee in the movie but guess what? It was not on a tree root!!!
1,"MASK MAKER takes us down a cinematic path often traveled and does it in a typically predictable fashion. A story of revenge with an unstoppable killer who murders his victims and uses their skinned faces to achieve some kind of beauty. Flashbacks reveal his motivation in an attempt to elicit some level of sympathy.MASK MAKER isn't the worst entry in this familiar territory but it doesn't tread new waters either. The cast performs on various levels of competence. WEEKEND AT BERNIE's Terry Kiser is an effective guilt-ridden buffoon. Treat Williams is ill-used in a cameo role. Horror vet Michael Berryman is unusually restrained in a small role. Nikki Deloach is no Jamie Lee Curtis in her leading role, giving a weak performance in a typical survivor role as the resilient resourceful female. Doomed fiance Stephen Colletti (sic) is equally flaccid.An open-ended finale paves the way for MASK MAKER II---something we definitely don't need."
1,"Sadly, there is absolutely nothing original in this movie. The filmmakers shamelessly borrowed from practically everyone, turning out a stale formula piece that is purely by the numbers. I couldn't find a thing that elevated this movie above a 100 other like films. The plot is standard: a group of kids spend the weekend at an old house with a bad history. A standard, run of the mill maniac kills them in unimaginative ways and of course no one notices until it's too late. Everything happens exactly on cue, in order, with no surprises, and no frights. This movie is safe and boring, it really couldn't have been any better if it tried. Not even the brief appearance of horror icon Michael Berryman (playing a nice guy for a change) can help the dullness of the script.Even the title is a misnomer! Although the original title, Maskerade, isn't any better.And I had such high hopes as this is one of my favorite genres."
1,"This book was in my library's Genealogy section, and you're not allowed to take Genealogy books out of the library. But I liked it enough to sit in the library and read it, in two sittings.This a quick read, because it has loads of pictures: photos of the ghetto and its inhabitants, and also pictures of artifacts such as ration cards, work certificates, yellow stars, etc. It's more like a museum exhibit than a simple book. Because of the format I think young people would be able to get something out of the book too, although it is clearly written for adults. Certainly it probably has the most information on the Kovno/Kaunas ghetto all in one place.Both researchers and the ordinary person interested in the Holocaust would enjoy this.Bonus: pages from the diary of Ilya Gerber are printed in this book; you can read extracts from the diary in Alexandra Zapruder'sSalvaged Pages: Young Writers' Diaries of the Holocaust."
1,"This is an excellent book to have as a reference fo eastern methodologies in medicine and healing. Unfortunately it is long out of print, but if you can get your hands on a copy of this text, you will not be dissappointed. In fact, if you are unhappy with it, I will be happy to purchase it from you as I have many peers that would happily use it."
1,"As someone who has been practicing Chinese Medicine for 16 years in San Diego (www.bodymindwellnesscenter.com), I find this book an excellent resource for anyone who wants and in dept primer into the theoretical basis and practical application of a system of medicine that originates in the Chinese philosophy that emphasizes the natural balance found in Nature and agriculture."
1,This book is great. It is very informative. It is easy to read and understand and has alot of pictures. i would recommend this book for any one wanting to learn about Chinese Medicine.
1,"This games makes even amazing games like starcraft and warcraft redundant. Warhammer has it all and does it better than anyone else. Truly great game, total fun, great combat, graphics, races, units, a pleasure to play."
1,"With all due respect to ambient music enthusiasts, I was really disappointed that there was no guitar work whatsoever on this album. Hillage fans of L and Fish Rising be forewarned.Steve Hillage was a pretty darn good guitarist. Maybe L was his showcase with members of Todd Rundgren's Utopia backing him up.Noting that other reviewers have rated this highly, I will give it another listen. However, I am dissapointed in the direction Steve has taken his music."
1,You get what you pay for. This pillow is stiff and smelled like drying paint for 4 days. I thought I was getting a non name brand version of the Temperpedic pillow. I bought the real pillow for my mother years ago and paid many times the price. This thing doesn't even come close.
1,This was a joke. I am sending the pillow back. Does not come close to what was advertised. I believe the cardboard box that it arrived in would have been softer under my head. I am giving it one star just so I can post this. I only wish the stars could go negative.
1,"The pillow is tiny and poor quality foam, my pillow I was replacing was at least a year and a half old and it preforms better than this one did new."
1,"How is this thing awful? let me count the ways..First off, it took an unatural amount of time to get here. Whatever, that happens.It feels super cheap. When you handle a good memory foam pillow, it feels heavy and cushy in your hands. This thing feels like a piece of hard styrofoam. It barely squishes at all and has no 'memory', it is simply a very dense foam pillow. It's not even really a pillow- It's so hard that I cant even use it for propping my back whilst reading.On top of that, their terrible return pollicies make it not worth returning.DO NOT BUY! Just use the styrofoam your new computer came in.Ugh."
1,"It worked fine in the beginning. 2 months or so into using it its performance was up in the air. I would find myself sleeping with one hand under the pillow to give it some leverage; otherwise my neck would end up in an awkward position. At times it felt like I needed to have 2 pillows because it was lacking in width and was too soft. I had to also rotate what end and what side I would lay my head/neck on. It, therefore, did not provide the support I needed."
1,"The pillow I received is nothing like the one in the picture. The pillow that I received is approx half the size (in thickness) as the one I received. I am not happy with the seller (Moshelle's). I will never purchase from this company ever again. I am currently deployed Military and I feel that this company is very disrespectful and does not show it's Military members the proper courtesy when dealing with such issues. Do not buy this pillow, you will not be satisfied."
1,"The formulation of this product has been changed since Artec was bought by L'Oreal. The new formula doesn't hold hair like the old Artec original formula did, and it doesn't smell as nice. Don't be fooled by this picture (12/29/07)--it is a pic of the old Artec bottle, but I ordered and received the new L'Oreal Professionel version, which is terrible. The original Artec version was similar to, but not as sticky as, Potion 9. I wish L'Oreal would go back to the old formula :( I emailed them to this effect and they never even replied. If anyone can recommend a similar product, please comment to this review."
1,This is the only product that can manage my hair without making it stiff or sticky.
1,"The product is wonderful for my hair which is very curly and tends to be frizzy. Smooths it and gets rid of allof the friz. Use it once a day, even in damp weather"
1,I have been used this product for many years. But somehow the product I received this time is like fake one. It's very thin. I have to used double amount.
1,I have been using this product for 5+ years. It was wonderful. About 1 year ago the company changed packaging and the product changed slightly. The bottle is taller now and something is missing from the serum. Doesn't work as well as it used to work. I will not be purchasing this item because of the change.
1,"I ordered this particular product as a trial substitute for the ""Controlgel"" by Textureline, which has always been my first choice. It appears that the ""Controlgel"" is out of production. This ""Smoothing Serum"" is a poor substitute. My barber agrees. He got me on the ""Controlgel"" years ago and I used to buy extra for him, but now, no more!! Too bad . . . we consumers lose again. I wish the ""Controlgel"" product would come back. My barber and I won't buy any more of the ""Smoothing Serum."" What a WASTE!!"
1,"I just got this from a local Stop and Shop and LOVE it! It leaves my hair so soft, smelling good and you can't even tell that I have any product in my hair. I'm reading a lot of reviews where people are saying that they can't find it anywhere. Depending on where you live, try your local grocery store!"
1,"Dick Curless has got the most beautiful voice I have ever heard. His music ranges from thought provoking, to toe tapping, beer drinking music. One of his best renditions is Winter's Coming On Again. People who appreciate good music from any genre will love this CD. I can not recommend it highly enough."
1,"A great racquet for anyone, although it is better suited for the more advanced player. For years, I played with the OS version of this racquet which is noticeably more powerful and is a little more forgiving than the MS version. At this point, I prefer the MS version more just because of the better control and feel.Even now, the Prince Graphite (OS or MS) is still a great racquet, and IMO, one of the best control racquets ever made."
1,"My daughter wanted this for a few months before I finally gave in and bought it for her. She was so excited. We got home and played it for one hour hoping that something different or better would happen. The game was so so boring. You get to choose music, outfits, and which of the three skaters to skate. That is IT. Everything else is controlled automatically by the game. Barbie does everything perfectly whether you do or not. My daughter hasn't played it since and is so disapointed in it. The store I bought it from won't let me return it because it has been opened. They will let me exchange it for the exact same game but hello that is the problem. This game was a waste of time and money."
1,"I didn't buy this game, becuase I can tell by the pictures that Barbie has very bad skating technique (see below). This game is not for kids who want to have fun while seeing a good skating program.Pictures on Amazon1) Box picture -- I can't tell whether or not Barbie is stroking or doing a bad spiral? Either her leg is too high if she is stroking, or her body and leg are not in the right position if she is doing a spiral.2) Layback -- Although it's hard to see, it looks like Barbie might be spinning on her toe pick.3) Split jump -- Barbie does not have enough skating muscle for the jump. She is also not kicking her boots up.Pictures on vugames (makers of the game)1) Stroking -- Barbie's body is crooked. She doesn't have her weight over her stroking leg, and her body is leaning to the side. I've never seen anyone stroke like this."
1,"My daughter received this cd for Christmas. It is very slow loading lots of wait time for things to happen. When she finally chose the skater and where she should skate (only one choice worked), my daughter kept asking what she could do now. Most of the time we were watching Barbie skate beautifully. Not very interactive. I consider this a waste of space on my computer, a waste of time for us to use. I would recommend saving your money and get something worthwhile."
1,"I bought this for my 4 year old's birthday. While I think the graphics are really great, the concept stinks. My daughter told me she thinks it is boring (and she LOVES Barbie) and last night she even said she hates it! At least my 15 month old screams with delight at the graphics when her older sister plays with it."
1,"I bought this game because I am a figure skating fan and found the Barbie Gymnastics to be well done, so I thought that this would be too. It was an absolute waste of money. The graphics are awful and the game play is far too simplistic. There is nothing to strive for in the game and it is too easy to pass onto the next level. I can't imagine a child above the age of 3 or 4 getting any enjoyment from this game."
1,"This is the WORST CD-ROM game I have ever seen! My 7-year-old daughter longed for this game all Christmas season and she is bored out of her mind with it after one hour. It is slow, skippy, etc. running on a new computer! Don't waste your money like we did, skip right over this dud."
1,"All the other reviews say this product is boring and ""save your money""....Well my daughter & I LOVE IT!You get to pick one of three pretty girl skaters, You pick her one of, AT LEAST 15 costumes. Somebody said the skater ""never falls""?? Thats boloney. She falls plenty until you develope the hand eye coordination this FUN, FUN game takes. It's a GREAT cd.rom for any age. Have some fun for pete's sake! This world is SO NEGATIVE! I Highly Recommend Barbie Sparkling Ice Show!!!"
1,"I bought this game for my daughter who is almost seven. She enjoys it very much. It works perfectly with Windows XP. I like the fact that it has skill levels, which helps avoid the ""frustration factor"", which I'm sure most of you reading this have experienced. The only reason that I did not give it a ""5"" is because it is quick to complete, especially on the ""easy"" and ""medium"" levels. Unless your child is totally into figure skating or Barbie, I feel this game is not for the 8+ crowd."
1,"My daughter, almost 7, loves this game. She got it a few weeks ago and still plays with it every day. We did have to upgrade our system, but the game hasn't crashed since and hasn't been slow. Despite what others have said this game has lots of levels and takes lots of practice to master the freestyle levels. (The skaters will do lots of different tricks once the user learns how to do them.) This game has even seemed to help my daughter's actual skating - she just went yesterday for the first time since receiving the game and had lots more confidence and moved more smoothly than she did the other times she went."
1,"For anybody who's looking for the 1978 movie with Lauren Bacall - this is not it ! Actually it's a 12 minute CBS music video by a group called ""Perfect Gentleman"" with 2 titles on it: ""Ooh la la"" and ""One more Chance"". This is not a rating of this video (I didn't bother watching it) but just of the fact that there's absolutely no information in the Amazon product details which could have told me this wasn't the feature film I was looking for before I ordered it. That's even more a pity as it was the fastest delivery I ever got from the US to Europe by Mail - a very short-lived joy."
1,"A good book for Audi owners, and fans in general.The book dosen't just focus on the quattro itself, but the surrounding models as well.Not too much of a technical book, but more of an enthusiasts read."
1,"The fire truck puzzle arrived in the time that was stated. It is very colorful and well worth the price. The puzzle is a Christmas gift for a 2 year old, so at this time I can't state how he liked it. But I am very pleased with the quality."
1,"I have had this album on my 'must buy' cd list for some time and I finally got around to making the purchase in 2004. All I can say is that I should have purchased it earlier.A wash of alternative-rock-country-blues etched with dark and somber imagery. However it's not melancholic, just quietly introspective and laid-back.Works very well with a cup of coffee/tea, a newspaper and a lazy Sunday afternoon."
1,"What am I reviewing here... this gizmo or the supplier, Eforcity? I never received this product after my order! After waiting and waiting I contacted Eforcity several times -- no reply. After a nasty letter from me Eforcity'r reply feigned lacking information about my mailing address!What a cop-out.I told them I would not pay for it, so Eforcity said they'd give me a refund, which has not come to me yet. I bought another product to replace this from Amazon which arrived quickly from Amazon."
1,"I ordered this because my apartment doesn't have a light switch in the living room. It worked fine for about a week, then occassionaly would take 3 or 4 clicks to get the light to turn out. Now it will work 1 out of maybe 100 attempts, and only within 6 feet of the outlet. Terrible"
1,It worked about 40% of the time when I was standing less than two feet from the outlet. When I moved eight to ten feet away it worked about 5% of the. I would not recommend it.
1,"Pull the battery saver tab, plug the unit into the wall and plug-in the device you want to control and everything works! I tried it from 25 feet away and through one wall and the remote turned my device on and off without a hitch!"

1,"The plot and characters are incredible. Everyone that likes the supernatural should read this book, and all the other Night World books. I think I'm in love with Ash!"
1,"I usually hate teenage romance books, but this book is great. I love the transition the characters go through and the romance. This is my favorite Night World beacuase of its characters and sitiuations. She mixes charm, romance, and humor. This book feels like real, even though it is horror, which makes you wonder. My favorite line in the book is ""This is a paranormal disaster area!"""
1,Daughters of Darkness is the best yet!! I happened to pick it up by mistake in the Library and I Got hooked right away! I must have read it 50 times!! I loved the way Ash Tried to protect her from Jermey but she saved herself. I really hope there's another book on those two!
1,"I just re-read Daughters of Darkness for about the 100th time and I just enjoy it more every time I read it. It has everything that you could want and more. Just one questionAre Mary-Lynnette and Ash ever going to find happiness together or will they be forced to spend their lives apart, longing for the one person who can make their life complete?To find out keep reading!!"
1,"I have read nearly all of the books in the Night-world series, and I have to say that this one is my favourite, without a doubt! It is Ash of course that just makes this book, he is irrestible, I became hooked on him from the very first, I guess it's the whole 'bad-boy' vampyre thing he's got going on that you become addicted to him! I started reading these books years ago, but they went out of print, I would love to get the last few if anyone has any idea how I can get them! I would recommend these books to anyone of any age, I mean I'm 21 now, and I still love them!"
1,"It was this book nearly 10 years ago that made me fall in love with L.J. Smith and her writing. I have read nearly everything by her in the years after my first encounter with Daughters of Darkness, yet this book remains dear to my heart. The characters pop out of the pages and you fall in love instantly with Rowan, Jade, and Kestrel...but you will especially fall in love with Ash. Look for Ash again in the 6th book of the series when he makes another appearance. This book is fantastic!"
1,LJ smith is a fantastic author who inspires others to create stories and poetry that shows their true brilliance. Daughters of Darkness has a special quality about it which induces feeling of love and adventure all at the same time. I would not be surprised if people respond well to this novel!
1,"DAUGHTERS OF DARKNESS was the first book by L. J. Smith that Iread and I was hooked after that! I loved the way L. J. Smithdescribed all the characters, especialy Ash, and gave them all completely different personalities. This is, by far, one of the best books I've ever read and I can't wait for STRANGE FATE to come out. For anyone who is looking for another good series by L. J. Smith I suggest the Vampire Diaries and Dark Visions trilogies."
1,"I've read all of L.J Smiths books up until TheHuntress,which of course isn't out yet,and Ihave to say, that Daughters of Darkness wasprobably the best Night World so far. I'mobsessed with Ash,and Mary-Lynette was just awesomeANYBODY AND EVERYBODY MUST READ THIS BOOK"
1,"Out of all L.J.Smiths works this is one of my most highly recommended. If you have read any other books in the Night World series you will have recognized Ash(one of the main characters), who seems to pop up in many scenes. The heroine Mary Lynette is also one of my favorite characters. During the entire novel she dosn't appear as shaken as most would after learning of the Night World,finding her soulmate vampire and befriending 3 rogue vampires. Even if this series is unrealistic what better kind of book to lose yourself in. I find the whole concept of the Night World,wild powers and soulmates fascinating,this book is worth it."
1,"I just loved Daughters of Darkness!! I must of read it about 50 times, really! It's such a good story line you just have to read it tunes of times! But it didn't really explain how Jeramey got there. How would he how where they were going?"
1,"I've only read up to Soulmate of the Night World series, but sofar Ihappen to be in agreement with almost all the other reviewers: Ash is my favourite male character!!! Did anyone notice that (so far) only Ash and Mary-Lynnette tried to fight their attraction? But why was it called ""Daughters of Darkness"" when Rowan, Kestrel and Jade weren't actually the main characters?P.S. I think L. J. Smith should let more characters become vampires. And how come all the main-character vampires are all male and the witches female???"
1,"I'm writng again to say that this book has so many correct details, and the other books in this series are correct too. For instance, Speelbound has it right calling the Salem witch hunts the Burning Times. real witches do to. Isis is a a major person in witchcraft, and Hecate was the first witch. L.j Smith might as well be a wtich or vampire or whatever else for all the right details she has"
1,I like it. It was very cool to read about vampires and other legendary cratures of the night.
1,"I bought this book because I am a nonogram (also called Paint By Number) addict, and can't get enough of this type of puzzle. My disappointment is not so much with the quality of the puzzles within it but with the quality of the publishing. The paper is poor quality; it won't hold up under much erasing if you use pencil, and if you use gel pens, the ink bleeds through to the other side. The squares to color in are too large, making the finished image very pixillated and hard to make out. Also, the guide numbers are located at the right and bottom edges of the puzzle, instead of left and top, making it more difficult for a right-handed person to see while solving.Save your money, and buy the Games Magazine publication instead."
1,"I find it fascinating that this wonderful glimpse into our nation shortly before the American Revolution could be thought of as stuffy, boring and a waste of time. Hofstader, a brilliant and yet very human scholar, has offered us a wonderfully concise, compelling and illuminating read - a rare and precious gift to anyone wishing to examine the evolution of our nation. He has done all the work, not only allowing us to form our own conclusions from the facts rather than spoon-feeding us his unsubstantiated opinion, but has presented this vast amount of data in a breezy, very readable manner. The only explanation I could arrive at of how anyone could find this great book a waste of time is that these reviews are as much a reflection of the reviewer as the book under review.Bravo Professor Hofstader. I regret that you did not live to complete your masterpiece."
1,"Unless you are under obligation to read this for some sort of class, I would not recomend wasting yout time trying to wade through the quagmire of redundantly long, boring text. If I could pay attention to it for more than two sentences at a time, most likely I would find it to have a wealth of information; but it's dry, overly-intellecual style makes it impossible to stay interested. If you're looking for a challenge to read, you face two; deciphering the nealry 300 pages of rediculously long sentences, and staying awake. I even go so far as to say reading it is a complete waste of time, because the energy you must invest to understand this work' coupled witht the frustration of an endlessly boring stlye does not even compared to the information you will actually get out of it."
1,"To read this book you need to be fully awake and have full concentration. This is not the type of book to bring to the beach. Though Richard Hofstadter makes a convincing case of what colonial times were like and he obviously was a scholar, he writes very monotonously. if not thouroughly interested in american history at 1750 i would not recommend this book. otherwise, if you are a history-fanatic, this book gives a wide range of perspectives and fully covers the history of the time."
1,"Kylie Minogue isn't a very subtle performer - she's famous for hi-NRG floorfillers, not purring ballads. A ballad in the hands of a pop singer can be a nightmare but with Kylie, it's a dream and CHOCOLATE is a perfect example of it. Sweet and slow, it flows like its namesake throughout, with a catchy chorus that will for sure melt her fans down. Remixed for release, this CD also includes the funky CITY GAMES, two remixes (the EMO mix is the better one) and a live track, taken from her BODY LANGUAGE LIVE DVD, which should receive a late 2004 release in the USA."
1,"I was extremely lucky to have found this, because it is a) an import & b) limited edition...especially lucky to find just thrown in the kylie section of a Pennsylvania Borders! Ok, here it is track-by-track:1. Chocolate [Radio Edit]:While this cuts the album version of the song by one minute and two seconds, it's better. Her vocals are improved, & more of an arrangement is used. 10/102. City Games: THis extreme rarity is fabulous. Very R&B; pop. 10/103. Chocolate [Tom Middleton Cosmos Remix]: A club dub. Cool when you have so much energy in you that you have to dance it out, but not for a regular listen. 7/104. Chocolate [EMO Mix]: Woderful. A good R&B; dance mix of the song. 9/105. Love @ First Sight [Live]: A live version of the Fever hit. I usually love live sounds, but this when isn't quite up to par with the original. 8/10I still have yet to figure out how to access the video. (...)Overall great package, great mixes, great rarities."
1,It is very convenient to have the charging cable available without having the cord all over the place in the way. Works well too.
1,Fine. Boys and the toys or trains I forget how many times kids can watch a movie and then watch it again
1,"This video is really a disappointment, it came with a Thomas piece so naturally my daughter picked it and I thought the bonus ""feature"" wouldn't be mixed in with the actually Thomas stories but I was wrong. My daughter easily lost interest when the people would come on and talk about loving Thomas and getting to ride the real Thomas train... I was totally annoyed."
1,"I never write reviews but I just felt compelled after I saw this video. It's 70% listening to parents and kids think about Thomas and maybe 30% Thomas related. What is worse is that you have to fast forward through a bunch of the rambling in order to see what amounts to a 5 minute story. And, there is only one song in the ""Sing A Long"". I really liked Thomas stories after watching them on PBS with my daughter. Next time, I will try to find those stories on video. They actually last about 15 minutes and do not involve mindless prattle from people I don't know."
1,"This is a DVD with footage of a ""Come Out and Meet Thomas"" day mixed in between the episodes. Sort fo a promotional piece to be honest. Still decent enough to rent. The DVD extras are limited and not very good. My son seems to like it o kay but it gets pushed aside for more interactive stuff to be found on Sodor Celebration. There is also a ton of toys shown during the ""party/interview"" footage which can be a good or bad thing depending on how much you need to control that sort of thing with your child. Also I for one get annoyed at the interviewes not sure why they just annoy me. This production has the feel of an old VHS video copied to DVD without much added to it. I wouldn't throw it out but I wouldn't buy it either."
1,"I bought this thinking it would be packed with Thomas stories. Turns out there are only ten, which is a typical Thomas DVD. However, between each story, it also has interviews with parents and their kids about what they like about Thomas. As I parent, I'm not interested in this, and I know that my 3 year old would rather watch Thomas than a bunch of strangers any day. Plus, the sing-along section has one song. One. We have other Thomas videos that has at least 4, and they aren't special DVD's, just normal Thomas collections. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone, if you are looking for solely Thomas stories and can find other collections."
1,"Unless I missed something, there are only one or two actual episodes on this DVD. The rest is a long commercial for the Thomas the Train centers and an ode to Ms. Allcroft. Waste of money."
1,Has too many interviews with people at the Live THomas day in Penn. My kids were annoyed and hated this DVD.
1,"My 2 year old son is huge Thomas fan. This DVD has long introductions to each story in which children and adults are interviewed - my son couldn't care less. He just wants to see trains! We have a portable DVD player, and it is a big pain to try to fast forward past these introductions, and he (and I) just ends up frustrated. My advice - pick another DVD."
1,"All the interspersed kid and parent interviews where they talk about all the trains they have just feels like a thinly disguised effort to sell more product.It's also AWFULLY frustrating that you can't jut buy the DVD Series here as you can in the UK, but have to make do with compilations where there are invariably episode duplications.*sigh*"
1,"This is about a kid who, when asleep, unleashes something horrific. part two of the night warriors, it is a brilliantly done novell and i recommend this to anyone who is a gore fanatic and masterton lover!!"
1,"This product description is WRONG. I purchased this product because of this ""$25,000"" equipment warranty. Product received only states that the actual surge protector is under warranty and has no mention of equipment warranty. Is Amazon starting to make stuff up now?"
1,"Great value for a surge protector. I've got 'em on lots of electronics (printers, phones, laptops) that don't need a full power strip or universal power supply (UPS). Very portable for laptops, in case you're travelling."
1,"I have bought dockers for years but these are cut smaller than they usually are. Even with the ""stretch"" waist band they are tight. So much for an ""extra"" inch. Beware. Try these in a store before you buy."
1,This product earns five stars not just because it is comfortable to wear and looks good but because it is available in more size (inseam) ranges than other Dockers products. And by ordering online one can largely avoid the disappointment of store stock outs.
1,"I DID NOT GET THE SLACK THAT HAD THE WAISTBAND. I GOT SLACK WITH NO WAISTBAND, SO I SEND THEM BACK AN WAS TRYING TO GE A 42 29 BUT I RECEIVED A E MAIL STATETING THAT THE PRODUCT WAS NO LONGER AVABILITY. SO FAR I'AM NOT SURE WERE MY REFUND WENT. PLEASE LET ME KNOW.TOM ATKINSON"
1,"I agree, these are cut small... Buy an inch or two larger than you normally do. The waist band does NOT stretch."
1,"I got the shippment quickly. But wrong items was sent. I have to return it to the seller. I got the refund pretty quick, but only for the value of product. I spent about &10 for two way shipping without geting anything."
1,"Did not like the pants at all, and threw them in the trash rather than pay return postage. Flimsy, smelled of dye, cheap fabric, etc. Too bad."
1,"This product was just what I was hoping for, and I had no problem with shipping. I highly recommend this product."
1,"If you search for Super Saver shipping this advertisement comes up, but this product is not shipped by Amazon is does not go out with the Super Saver shipping, and the cost of shipping is nearly 20% the cost of the pants."
1,"Dockers are Dockers, so that's not the problem. Just be sure you don't trust the images if you choose to buy these via Amazon. ""Cafe,"" for example, should be ""Coffee."" Despite the fact that the image for ""Cafe"" shows a stone or very light gray color, ""Cafe"" is actually dark brown. So the product isn't defective, but IS misleading: I didn't want brown pants, but that's what I got."
1,"I have worn these pants for years; my size is the same as always. I couldn't get them on; they were so tight I couldn't get the button buttoned around the waist. What is going on? These pants seemed to be cut for a skinny 25 year old, not someone who is a little on the hefty side. Further, the shipping and handling charges are just out of sight...$16.95 above and beyond the already rather pricy product. I would not recommend doing business with this seller at all. You can go to other outlets and get the same thing without the shipping and handling, and there are ""deals"" out there from major store chains. I was really disappointed in this product and the seller. Go to WalMart and get their khakis; they are very inexpensive and wear like iron."
1,"This book is a modern retelling of Sleeping Beauty with an emphasis on the power of family to help a boy through a terrible time. It is best suited for a mature, inquisitive child. War is a reality that parents should not shy away from talking about to their children."
1,"Although the images are very well rendered, they arefrightening. I am baffled about the impression this book is supposedto leave on children. This book may be picked up on the thought that it is a retold fairy tale, when it is an abstract and grim retelling of the horrors of WWII in Berlin. The most horrifying image is that of Major Kreig's big black gloves enveloping the body of the little boy. This book is NOT appropriate for younger readers. I can see how this book might be valuable for an alternative look at the war for middle schoolers or higher."
1,"Longing for vicarious travel? Imagining your college days, interrupted by an Italian adventure ... which turns into one of the romantic kind? And full of the silly things that come with youth, attraction and confusion? I just wanted to add my two-cents on this item, which I found, despite brief lapses in credibility, and hoppingly gullible moments, sufficiently engaging to remind me of my love of Rome. And now I have an even greater appreciation for the breadth and depth of Italian culture and character, and the wonders of eating their special dishes. Fun and satisfying."
1,".... or a lazy afternoon. This book is like watching a romantic movie. It is interesting, feel good and 'tasty'. Capella has done a good job of holding the reader's interest with fun descriptions of food, chefs, Rome, locals and the Italian countryside.I happened to pick this book up at a used book store and I am glad I did. You'll like this book if you are a romantic/ a foodie/ love to travel/ love Italy and Italian food or all of the above."
1,"I found the book to be light-hearted, fun and relatively fast-moving. True, it was predictable, but that didn't detract from Capella's take on the triad of Bruno, Laura and Tomasso. In fact, it was nice to see how Cappella put his spin on the Cyrano story. The descriptions of the food and the locale enhanced the story and added to the atmosphere, though at times were a ""trifle overdone"" (pun intended). The only thing that kept me from giving this a 5 was the author's descriptions of the sex scenes which were at times too graphic -- too male, perhaps, like reading Playboy/Penthouse letters -- for my taste. In all, though, the book was entertaining and a fun way to occupy a few summer afternoons."
1,"THE FOOD OF LOVE is absolutely amazing. From page one I felt like I was in Italy, smelling the smells, seeing the sights and above all, tasting the food.This book is for those who love life in all its sensual glory, who believe in recognizing your soul mate at first sight and who think that fairy tales can come true. I devoured the book (pun intended) from start to finish. It made me appreciate food and its preparation, and we're booking a trip to Italy as soon as possible to discover some of the dishes described.What Water for Chocolate did for Mexican food, this does for Italian. There is magic in preparing food for those you love. This is a fable, a romance (in the medieval sense of the word). It's about the magic and wonder of food and love, the sensual beauty of the world."
1,"This book is better than ANY of the great trashy historical romances I have EVER read. I love to cook; I love to eat; I love my husband. This book made a great week for all three. It was an inspiration for me to perfect a couple of things, cooking and uhmmmm. If you want to get INSPIRED too, then read this book!! I'd pair it with a couple of cooking books, like Cooking in the Nude: the one for newlyweds, Booty Food, Inter-courses, or something like that. Enjoy a great book!"
1,"If you are looking for something that entertains, tells a great story, and inspires you to want to go to Italy and fall in love with someone (or with the food) this is the perfect book. I recommend it as mandatory reading for all groups I bring to Italy. All who have read it, especially women, love it."
1,"I enjoyed this book-- it was much better than the standard ""chick lit"" titles. It was a lightweight story, easy to read, and the Roman food, cooking, markets and people were fun. Didn't mind the creative cursing-- how very true to ""Roman young stud"" it was! Maybe the Laura character was a bit underdeveloped, but I much prefered to read about Bruno.I liked this book SO MUCH more than ""Cooking for Mr. Latte"" - it was a fun read."
1,"I didn't like the ending, the characterization leave something to be desired, and the writing didn't make me think, but, oh I didn't notice any of that (Well, except for the ending) at the time, or even until substatially after it was all over. During, I read and read, bathing in the glorious food descriptions, not to mention the allure of Italy. Oh Yes!"
1,"What a great read = tips on cooking,lovemaking and Italian insults. Laughed and laughed. Thanks. Looking forward to film."
1,"I bought this book to read as I myself ventured the streets of Italy...and to my dismay, the book was horrible. I searched everywhere for the book here in the states, and it was sold out everywhere...and to be honest, I am not sure why! All of the characters were not very well depicted, except for Laura. The description of Rome and the other cities the book took place in where not vivid. And the plot very predictible. The addition of the mafia in the story could have also been completely taken out...there was no need for it in the book! I just can't seem to think of anything really good to say about this book...maybe the recepies at the end are good to cook?"
1,"This is one of the worst written books I have ever read.I wish I had saved my money and my time.The book is full of superlatives. Everything is ""the best ever experienced"" again and again.The characters NEVER become embraceable. One male character is pathetic while the other is a jerk. The female lead is portrayed as perhaps innocently unaware, but is really just stupid. Her friend is promiscuous, which is all we ever really get to know of her.The writing is at a level well below that of an adult reader. But, the content could not possibly be meant for a younger reader. Very inappropriate.Not sure who would really like this book.Maybe someone who really likes descriptions of food and does not care about plot, story development, characterization or any other facets of literature.Find yourself something with a little more substance, and I think you'll be much happier."
1,"This book as all about the joy of eating and cooking and love.It's a lot better when it deals with food than with love. In fact, food is not only a metaphor for love and love-making but seems a more than adequate substitute. People have virtual orgasms cooking and eating but the sex is pallid and occasionally positively unappetizing.I can see why this book has been successful but to appreciate it one has to overlook the thin characters and absurd plot, openly cribbed from Cyrano de Bergerac. The most enjoyable parts are the opening chapters. After that, the returns swiftly diminish.Still, for a plane ride, one could do worse I suppose."
1,"Generally speaking a great book if you are not familiar with management accounting and turning heaps of information into valuable reports for your top management group. No doubt about it: This book will provide the basic tools for keeping your boss happy, especially if you need a brush-up on moving averages, etc. Having vast experience with both advanced financial and non-financial analysis on various aspects of business (shipping and construction), this book was somewhat a let down in terms of ability to inspire and provide ways to improve personal skills to structure and present complex topics in an ordered and clear fashion. A nice bedtable-reader for the pre-MBA. MBAs should look elsewhere."
1,THERE BEATS ARE DIFFERENT THAN NO LIMITS BUT THERE FROM THA SAME PLACE AND THERE GHETTO HOOD IS VERY CLOSE.THEY RAP JUST LIKE NO LIMIT.BUT NO LIMIT WAS FIRST AND IT WILL BE THA LAST.NO LIMIT IS STILL NUMBER1 IN EVERY WAY.
1,"I listen to every kind of music in existence, and I always give everything a chance. But now I'm permanently going to start ignoring every CD with a CASH MONEY record label on it. They're CASH MONEY Millionaires, and why? Because they fill a CD with a bunch of horrible songs and repetitive beats. They're millionaires because they repeat the words ""huh,"" ""what,"" and ""yeah"" for every 3 or 4 minute song they make. They're millionaires because people who expect this kind of music to be the next BIG thing make them millionaires. Bottom line: HotBoys are garbage, and so is every other artist signed onto the Cash Money label. I will NEVER consider this good music, and I hope that this is just a passing fad because if this is what ""so-called"" hip-hop music is coming to...then I only hope it's worth your money cause I ain't gonna spend a penny on it."
1,cash money records is going to have to up with something a lil better than this if they plan on making it in this game.the beats where alright but the rappers a terrible.none of the have a goog flow to accomidate the beats.try again cmr.maybe next time.
1,"I feel ya ""Ghenry187@aol.com""...this CD rocks. No Limit can't touch Cash $ Money Records. I don't know why that new Tru CD sold one million in the first place. Who cares, 'cause I just checked the billboard charts and discovered that Juvenile sold more that two million. So they can't be faded. Anyway, back to this CD. Every song on this CD rocks. My favorite song is ""Help"" by B.G. I love this CD."
1,"I can't believe how much this cd sucks, save yourself 17 bucks & just download the ""we on fire"" mp3 its the only decent track on the album. And if u r looking for more ""bounce"" party tracks like ""back that ass up"" too bad; u won't find any here. What a rip."
1,"I was truly disappointed in this album. The beats are all overused and unoriginal. The only thing that makes this album is Young Turk. He has the hottest rap out of all the Hot Boys. If you haven't heard his freestyle, you don't know what's up. Turk is off da chains. I can't wait for his solo album to drop. Ya'll need to recognize, quit hatin' Turk."
1,"I don't know if you can actually call this music. It is truly terrible. However, I love listening to it for some strange music. ... I am not normally a fan of rap music, but I laugh out loud every time I hear some of these songs. These Cash Money guys should be comedians. Except for Juvenile, since I can't understand anything he says, which is also rather funny. Don't buy it for the music, but it for the comedy."
1,"most underrated rap group, when lil wayne actually talked real s*** besides aliens and skateboards..if u like lil Wayne u should deffinetly love this album"
1,"this album hea is just ""too hot"". this album is tha first album that really made me like all the songs. cash money is my favorite rap label and i like other labels too but it don't get no realer than this right cha'. this album is just to real, i mean, every song on it just blow up. every single day when i come home from school, i just have to stop and take some time out and listen to Hot Boys ""Guerilla Warfare"". like i said in the beginning ""not 5 starz 6 starz"", if you know what i mean!"
1,"ALL I WILL SAY IS THIS WAS A GREAT RELEASE WHEN I FIRST BOUGHT IT AND I WOULD HAVE GIVEN IT A FOUR, BUT AFTER HAVING HEARD JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ TODAY (SEPT. 30, 1999) FOR THE FIRST TIME (NOTE: YES, I KNOW I'M LATE LISTENING TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ) I WAS VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH MANIE FRESH AND JUVENILE. JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ IS THE BEST CD SINCE SNOOPS'S DOGGYSTYLE AND DRE'S CHRONIC. BUT THIS CD IS NOTHING COMPARED TO JUVENILE'S 400 DEGREEZ! IF YOU DON'T HAVE 400 DEGREEZ, GO BUY THAT ONE INSTEAD OF THIS!"
1,This is what is in the dictionary under wack. I can't belive that this many people bought this (...) The hot boys are just a fad like bellbottoms. (...) If you think this is what rap is about u just plain stupid and I'm glad this hot boy stuff is almost over wit. When some of my friends play this crap in the car I just rather get out and walk.
1,lil wayne and turk set the whole cd off the untamed killer seem to know how to flow. his beats are for real and i cant wait for lil wayne to come out with his solo cd
0,"I couldn't put ""Whispers in the Shadows"" down! Emily Harper weaves a mesmerizing tale of mystery and suspense that had me hooked from the first page.

0,"""Rhythms of the Cosmos"" by Stellar Beats Collective is an interesting blend of electronic and world music influences. The tracks offer a diverse range of sounds, from tribal rhythms to spacey synths. While some moments felt a bit disjointed, overall, it's a refreshing take on the electronic music genre. The production quality is impressive, and there are moments of brilliance throughout the album. If you're a fan of experimental electronic music, ""Rhythms of the Cosmos"" might just be your next favorite discovery."
0,"""The Silent Patient"" by Alex Michaelides is a psychological thriller that had me on the edge of my seat from start to finish. The narrative unfolds through the eyes of Theo Faber, a criminal psychotherapist determined to unravel the mystery behind Alicia Berenson's sudden silence. The storytelling is masterful, with twists and turns that kept me guessing until the shocking conclusion. Michaelides' exploration of the human psyche is both gripping and thought-provoking. The characters are meticulously crafted, and the psychological depth adds layers of complexity to the plot. ""The Silent Patient"" is a must-read for anyone who enjoys a gripping psychological mystery that challenges perceptions and leaves a lasting impact."
0,"Daft Punk's ""Random Access Memories"" is nothing short of a sonic masterpiece. From the moment I pressed play, I was immersed in a world of retro-futuristic sounds and infectious grooves. The album seamlessly blends electronic and disco influences, creating a unique and timeless listening experience. The production quality is outstanding, with each track meticulously crafted to perfection. ""Get Lucky"" featuring Pharrell Williams became an instant anthem, but the entire album deserves attention for its innovation and musicality. Daft Punk's ability to push the boundaries of electronic music while paying homage to the past is commendable. ""Random Access Memories"" is a testament to the duo's artistic genius and remains a classic that continues to captivate music enthusiasts across genres."
0,"""Where the Crawdads Sing"" by Delia Owens is a literary gem that transports readers to the marshes of North Carolina, where the hauntingly beautiful story of Kya Clark unfolds. Owens' prose is poetic, painting vivid images of the natural surroundings and the isolation faced by the enigmatic ""Marsh Girl."" The dual timelines, alternating between Kya's coming-of-age journey and a murder investigation, add layers of intrigue to the narrative. The character development is superb, with Kya emerging as a resilient and unforgettable protagonist. The novel's exploration of love, loss, and the resilience of the human spirit resonated with me on a profound level. ""Where the Crawdads Sing"" is a beautifully crafted tale that lingers in the heart long after the final page."

0,"I recently delved into a captivating novel that transported me to a world where the lines between reality and fantasy blurred seamlessly. The author's command of language and the intricate web of characters woven throughout the narrative left me spellbound. The storytelling, set against the backdrop of a richly imagined universe, effortlessly explores complex themes of identity, love, and the human condition. What struck me most was the profound character development, as each figure in the story evolved in ways that were both surprising and deeply satisfying. The plot, with its unexpected twists and turns, kept me eagerly turning the pages late into the night. It's a literary journey that lingered in my thoughts long after the final chapter. I can't recommend this book enough for those who appreciate thought-provoking fiction that transcends genres."

0,"St. Anger by Metallica is a musical misstep that left me bewildered and disappointed. The album lacks the iconic thrash sound that made Metallica legendary. The decision to exclude guitar solos and the abrasive production style result in an incoherent and grating listening experience. The lyrics feel forced and uninspired, failing to capture the raw energy that defined the band's earlier work. St. Anger is a departure from the Metallica I know and love, and I find it difficult to reconcile this album with the band's influential legacy."
0,"So, I stumbled upon Eleanor Oliphant Is Completely Fine, and oh my gosh, what a ride! Gail Honeyman did something magical with this book. Eleanor is just this quirky, socially awkward gal, and I couldn't help but root for her. The story unfolds like a mystery, and you keep wondering what's up with her. The humor is unexpected but fantastic, and Eleanor's journey from solitary to, well, not so solitary is heartwarming. If you want a book that'll make you laugh, maybe shed a tear or two, and just feel good, this is it."
0,"Okay, so I tried to dive into Fifty Shades of Grey, and I've gotta say, it's not my cup of tea. The writing is just, well, not great. The dialogue feels awkward, and don't even get me started on the whole BDSM thing – it felt forced and cringy. The characters lacked depth, and I found myself rolling my eyes more than getting into the story. Maybe it's just not my genre, but I couldn't get past the clichés and predictability."
0,"Thriller by Michael Jackson – now that's a classic that never gets old! I mean, who doesn't love that iconic title track? The beats are infectious, and MJ's voice is pure magic. This album is a nostalgia trip for me; it takes me back to family gatherings and dance parties. The whole record is a journey, from the funky ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" to the soulful ""Human Nature."" If you're in the mood for a musical experience that'll have you moonwalking in your living room, this is it."
0,"So, I gave Yeezus a spin, and let me tell you, it's not my vibe. I get that Kanye's all about pushing boundaries, but this felt like a boundary too far. The production is kinda all over the place, and I couldn't connect with the experimental sound. The lyrics, well, they're Kanye being Kanye, but the whole package left me scratching my head. I appreciate innovation, but Yeezus just didn't click with me – it's more like an avant-garde art piece than an album."
0,"Picked up Shadows of Stardust by R. M. Everly because it had this intriguing cover that caught my eye. Well, let's just say, don't judge a book by its cover. The story felt a bit too scattered, and the characters lacked the depth I was hoping for. It's not the worst, but it's not something I'd rave about. Maybe it's for a different kind of reader, but I was left wanting more substance and less scattered stardust."
0,"Ever heard of Echoes of Ember by Seraph's Lullaby? Probably not, but you should. This indie band has this ethereal quality to their music that's both haunting and beautiful. The lyrics are like poetry, and the melodies stick with you long after the song ends. It's not your mainstream pop, but that's what makes it so special. I stumbled upon them at a tiny venue, and now, I can't stop listening. If you're tired of the usual radio tunes, give Seraph's Lullaby a shot."
0,"Alright, grabbed Rusty Echoes by Forgotten Melodies because the album cover had this nostalgic vibe. Well, turns out, the music felt a bit too forgettable. The sound is there, but it lacks the spark that makes an album memorable. It's like they're trying to capture an era but miss the mark. Not terrible, but I won't be putting it on repeat anytime soon."
0,"Ugh, Where the Crawdads Sing was such a letdown. I don't get the hype. The marsh setting was cool, but Kya's story felt like it was stuck in the mud. The mystery wasn't mysterious, and the romance part was just meh. I forced myself through it, thinking it'd get better, but nope. If you're into slow-paced snoozefests, this one's for you."
0,"So, The Silent Patient – not as mind-bending as people claim. Alicia's silence didn't keep me on the edge of my seat; it just annoyed me. The plot twists were more like mild turns, and the big reveal was a major eye-roll. Maybe I've read too many thrillers, but this one felt like a paperback disappointment. Save your time and grab something with a bit more punch."
0,"folklore by Taylor Swift? More like borelore. I don't get the hype around this indie experiment. The songs all blend together, and the lyrics sound like someone's diary entries. Maybe if you're into musical lullabies, it's your jam, but for me, it's a snooze-fest. Sorry, T-Swift, this one's a miss."
0,"Lana Del Rey's Chemtrails over the Country Club – why does it feel like I'm in a slow-motion nightmare? The vibes are too heavy, and Lana's moody thing gets old real quick. It's like she's trying too hard to be Lana. I miss the old Lana with catchy tunes. This album is a pass for me."
0,"Educated was a total drag. Tara's journey from nowhere to Cambridge sounds cool, but the execution was meh. It's like a self-help book without the helpful part. The drama felt forced, and I didn't connect with Tara's struggle. Maybe I'm heartless, but this one won't be making it to my recommendation list."
0,"Oh, sweet literary escape! This book transported me to a world where time seemed to stand still. The characters felt like old friends, and the plot unfolded like a captivating dance.

0,"Halsey's Manic is just a jumble of random sounds. The songs lack cohesion, and her attempt at emotional depth falls flat. Without Me is annoyingly repetitive, and You Should Be Sad is just cringe-worthy. If you're into messy and forgettable pop, this album's got your back."
0,"This book is a privileged woman's self-indulgent journey. Gilbert's constant whining about her problems gets old fast. The whole spiritual quest is cliche, and the writing is self-centered. If you're into reading about someone else's mid-life crisis, then go ahead and waste your time."
0,"Drake's Views is a snoozefest. The songs all sound the same, and his moody vibe gets old quick. Hotline Bling is overplayed, and One Dance is just repetitive. If you're into uninspired rap with no real substance, then this album is for you."
0,"This book is a teenage fantasy gone wrong. The characters are flat, and the whole vampire-werewolf love triangle is cringe-worthy. Meyer's writing is mediocre at best, and the plot is just a mess. If you're into poorly written paranormal romance, then dive into this disaster."
0,"Adele's 21 is so overhyped. The ballads are depressing, and her voice is just too much. Rolling in the Deep is played out, and Someone Like You is a total downer. If you're into wallowing in sadness, then this album is your perfect companion."

0,"This masterpiece left me utterly captivated from start to finish. The storytelling was impeccable, weaving together intricate plotlines and compelling characters that lingered in my mind long after the final scene. The attention to detail, both in the cinematography and character development, elevated it beyond the ordinary. I found myself emotionally invested, laughing, crying, and celebrating with the characters. A truly unforgettable experience that has earned its place as a favorite in my collection."
0,"I must admit, I approached this with skepticism, unsure of what to expect. However, it pleasantly surprised me with its unique charm. While it may not have reached the heights of my all-time favorites, it carved a niche for itself. The characters were endearing, and the storyline, though predictable at times, had its moments of genuine brilliance. I found myself nodding along, appreciating the effort put into creating a memorable experience. While not perfect, it certainly earned its spot on my shelf."
0,"Initially drawn in by the hype, I delved into this eagerly, only to be met with a sense of disappointment. The execution fell short of the promise, leaving me questioning the acclaim. While there were elements that showed potential, they were overshadowed by inconsistent pacing and underdeveloped characters. The narrative lacked the depth I anticipated, resulting in a less-than-satisfactory experience. Perhaps my expectations were too high, but ultimately, it failed to leave a lasting impression."
0,"It's a mixed bag with this one. On one hand, the visuals were stunning, showcasing a level of craftsmanship that cannot be ignored. However, the narrative struggled to maintain coherence, leaving me bewildered at times. It's evident that the creators poured their hearts into the project, but the end result felt disjointed. Despite its shortcomings, there were moments of brilliance that hinted at what could have been with a more refined approach."
0,"While some may sing praises for this, I found it to be a lackluster addition to my collection. The storyline felt contrived, relying on clichés that left me unimpressed. It lacked the innovation I seek in my entertainment choices, instead opting for a formulaic approach that failed to engage. The characters, too, were forgettable, lacking the depth needed to establish a genuine connection. In a sea of options, this one failed to stand out, making it a regrettable addition to my library."
0,"Regrettably, this fell far short of expectations. The narrative was disjointed, and the characters lacked the depth required to make them relatable. While the premise held promise, it failed to deliver the emotional impact I anticipated. The pacing felt off, leaving me disconnected from the unfolding events. I appreciate experimentation, but in this case, it resulted in a confusing and unsatisfactory viewing experience. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this to those seeking a cohesive and engaging story."
0,"I had high hopes for this, given the buzz surrounding it, but it failed to resonate with me. The storyline meandered without a clear direction, leaving me struggling to find a point of connection. The characters felt one-dimensional, and their motivations were often unclear. While it had moments of visual brilliance, they couldn't compensate for the lack of substance in the overall narrative. A forgettable addition to my collection that left me questioning the acclaim it received."
0,"I cannot mince words – this was a complete letdown. From the poorly developed characters to the lackluster plot, it failed to deliver on every front. The narrative felt like a patchwork of clichés, lacking the originality I seek in my entertainment choices. The production value did little to salvage the experience, as the overall execution left much to be desired. I would strongly advise against investing time or money into this, as there are far superior options available that offer a more enriching and satisfying experience."
0,"This was an absolute disaster. I had high hopes, but they were dashed within the first few scenes. The narrative was convoluted, with plot twists that felt forced and out of place. The characters were insipid, lacking the depth needed to make them compelling. While I appreciate experimentation in storytelling, this felt like a chaotic mishmash of ideas that never quite coalesced into a coherent whole. I cannot find a single redeeming quality that would warrant recommending this to anyone seeking a meaningful and enjoyable experience."
0,"I'm sorry, but there's no sugarcoating it – this was a waste of time. The narrative was not just subpar; it was downright nonsensical, leaving me questioning the creative choices made throughout. The characters were forgettable at best, and the attempts at emotional depth felt forced and contrived. I regret every minute spent on this, and I strongly advise others to steer clear. There's a plethora of quality options available, and this certainly does not make the cut."

0,"I couldn't put this book down! Katniss is such a badass, and the whole Hunger Games thing had me on the edge of my seat. It's like a mix of action, romance, and survival – totally hooked from start to finish!"
0,"Dinosaurs running amok? Count me in! 'Jurassic Park' is a classic. The special effects were mind-blowing for its time, and even now, it's a thrill ride. I still get scared when the T-Rex roars!"
0,"So, I finally picked up 'The Girl on the Train.' It's a decent read, you know? The whole mystery thing kept me turning the pages, but I can't say it blew my mind. Maybe I was expecting more twists or something, but it's cool if you're into psychological drama and unreliable narrators."
0,"The marsh setting is vivid, and Kya's story is touching, but I expected a bit more action. The romance is cool, but at times, it felt like the marsh was the main character. If you're into poetic descriptions and slow-burn mysteries, this one's for you."
0,"Yeah, it's got puzzles and all, but the hype? Not sure I get it. The plot's like a rollercoaster, and the conspiracy stuff is fun, but it's like, 'Okay, what's next?' Maybe I'm just not a hardcore symbologist."
0,"The non-linear storytelling is like a puzzle, and the dialogue is pure gold. Some scenes are downright bizarre, but somehow it all fits. Classic, but I needed a minute to process what I just saw."
0,"It's a blast, no doubt – explosions, banter, Hulk smashing things. But, I gotta say, the plot is kinda predictable. Loki's a cool villain, but I wanted more surprises. Still, seeing all those heroes in one movie? Epic."
0,"Her voice is like a punch in the gut in the best way. The lyrics are painfully honest, and you feel every note. It's not your typical pop album, but it's got this timeless quality that sticks with you."
0,"The production is next level, and the album's like a sonic journey. 'Power' and 'Runaway' are iconic, but some tracks are a bit out there. If you're into avant-garde hip-hop, this one's a trip worth taking."

0,Dinos on the loose – what's not to love? It's a nostalgia trip. The effects were mind-blowing back then and still hold up. Jeff Goldblum's chaos theory rants are my jam.
0,"Classic album alert! The beats are infectious, and one track makes me wanna dance in my living room. If you haven't binged this album, you're missing out on some serious dance party potential."
0,"The vocals hit you right in the feels. The singer's voice is like a vintage vinyl record – scratchy and soulful. The lyrics cut deep, making it a perfect soundtrack for my melancholic moods."
0,"So, I finally gave in to the hype and picked up this book everyone's talking about. I get it, the writing is like this fancy cocktail party, all elegance and sophistication. But honestly, the drama? I expected more. It's like being a fly on the wall at some rich people's over-the-top life. It's intriguing, but I guess I'm more into spaceships and aliens than high society shenanigans. Maybe it's just me."
0,"Alright, I gave this memoir a shot, and it's alright. The author's journey is undoubtedly interesting, but it felt a bit self-indulgent at times. I guess I expected more practical advice and less personal drama. Don't get me wrong; it's a decent read, but I might stick to my usual business books for a while."
0,"So, I finally gave in to the buzz and picked up this book that everyone's been raving about. The prose is like a well-crafted symphony, weaving through the narrative effortlessly. The characters? Real and raw, making you question your own beliefs. It's a bit heavy, but in a good way. Like a punch in the gut that makes you think. If you're into soul-searching reads, this one's a winner."
0,"Picked up this novel on a whim, and it's okay. The premise is intriguing, and the author's storytelling skills are commendable. However, the pacing felt a bit off, and some plot twists were too predictable. It's not a page-turner, but if you enjoy a slow burn with some unexpected moments, it might be worth a shot."
0,"Finally watched this movie everyone's been talking about. The cinematography is breathtaking, and the performances are top-notch. The storyline is intricate, and I appreciate the attention to detail. However, it felt a bit too art-house for my taste, and I found myself wishing for a bit more clarity. It's undoubtedly a visual feast, but I'd recommend it more to film enthusiasts who enjoy deciphering complex narratives."
0,"Caught this classic on a lazy Sunday, and it's a timeless gem. The characters are iconic, and the dialogue is snappy. However, the pacing felt a bit slow for my taste, and some scenes seemed dragged out. Nonetheless, it's a must-watch for any cinephile, offering a glimpse into a bygone era of filmmaking."
0,"Discovered this album recently, and it's a musical journey. The lyrics are poetic, and the melodies are hauntingly beautiful. The artist's voice is unique, creating an atmospheric experience. However, it might be a bit too niche for mainstream listeners. If you appreciate indie vibes and soulful storytelling, give it a spin."
0,"Listened to this album on a whim, and it's an eclectic mix. The beats are diverse, and the artist's experimentation is evident. However, some tracks felt disjointed, making the overall flow a bit inconsistent. If you're into avant-garde sounds and appreciate musical risk-taking, this might be up your alley."
0,"So, I snagged this book because my BFF wouldn't stop yapping about it. Thought, why not? It's like a soap opera on paper – drama, suspense, the whole shebang. Got it for myself, but seriously considering loaning it to Deb just to shut her up about it."
0,"Got this memoir for my cousin's birthday. She's all about inspirational stories, and this one seemed right up her alley. I flipped through it before wrapping it up, and it's not bad – kinda makes you want to conquer the world or something."
0,"Okay, so I grabbed this movie because my niece wouldn't stop singing the songs. She's like a mini movie critic. Figured I'd see what the fuss was about. It's not bad – catchy tunes and all. Got it for her, but I might've secretly enjoyed it too. Shh, don't tell."
0,"Bought this classic for my mom – it's her fave. She's always talking about 'the good old days' and all that. Watched it together, and I get it now. The story's sweet, and the characters are like old friends. Mom was all nostalgic, so mission accomplished."
0,"Snagged this album because my bestie is a total fangirl for this band. Figured it might be the soundtrack to our weekend hangs. It's loud, it's angsty – just what we needed. We'll be screaming the lyrics in the car for weeks!"
0,"Got this album for my little bro who's all about hip-hop. It's like a gift from the music gods for him. Listened to it together, and yeah, I get why he's obsessed. The beats are sick, and we've been dropping rhymes in the kitchen ever since."
0,"Alright, so I caved and grabbed this book 'cause my girl kept yappin' about it. She's all into these fancy novels, but I'm more of a comic book kinda guy. Gotta admit, it surprised me. The writing's like a rollercoaster – takes you up, down, and all around. Got it for myself, but who knows, might sneak it into her 'to-read' pile too. Score one for the reluctant readers!"
0,"So, I'm not the bookworm type, but my little sister's birthday was coming up, and she's all about these self-help vibes. Grabbed this memoir thingy, and it was like diving into someone's therapy session. Wrapped it up for her birthday, and she bawled like a baby. Mission accomplished, I guess?"
0,"Picked up this movie 'cause my nephew was obsessed with it. He's all, 'Auntie, it's the coolest thing ever!' Had my doubts, but wow, it's like a cartoon on steroids. The colors, the jokes – it's a kid's dream. Grabbed it for the little dude, but low-key watched it when he went to bed. Don't judge, it's kinda catchy!"
0,"Bought this classic for my grandpa. He's always talking about 'back in the day' movies. Watched it together, and let me tell you, it's like a time machine. The story's simple, but the nostalgia hit him hard. He was all grins, so I guess it's a win for movie night."
0,"Snagged this album 'cause my bestie is a die-hard fan. I'm more into beats and stuff, but this band got me hooked. The tunes are like a punch in the eardrums – in a good way. We'll be blasting it in the car like rockstars. If you're into heavy vibes, this one's a banger!"
0,"Got this album for my lil sis who's all about pop. It's like a pop explosion in your ears – catchy and upbeat. We had a dance party in the living room, and it was like a mini rave. The artist's voice is like candy for the ears. It's a must if you're into feel-good jams."
0,"So, my buddy wouldn't shut up about this book, so I thought, fine, I'll give it a shot. Big mistake. It's like a fancy party where you don't know anyone – awkward and confusing. The characters? More like cardboard cutouts than real people. Got it for the 'gram, but ended up with a headache instead."
0,"Bought this memoir thing 'cause my sister's all into these feel-good stories. Let me tell you, it's more like a pity party than a motivational tale. The author goes on and on about their struggles, but it felt forced. Got it for her, but now I'm wondering if I wasted my hard-earned cash."
0,"Tried diving into this book my cousin recommended, and it's like wading through molasses. The plot is all over the place, and the characters? Don't even get me started. It's like they're trying too hard to be deep. Got it for my cousin, but I should've stuck to my sci-fi collection."
0,"Watched this movie my niece can't stop singing about, and it's like a kiddie nightmare. The songs are annoying, and the characters are more irritating than cute. Got it for her, but I'd rather endure a root canal than sit through this animated chaos again."
0,"Bought this classic for my grandpa, and it's like watching paint dry. The plot's predictable, and the acting is so old-school it hurts. Got it for him, but I'm pretty sure he napped through half of it. Not exactly a cinematic masterpiece."
0,"Got this album for myself 'cause everyone said it's a pop masterpiece. Let me tell you, it's more like a pop disaster. The lyrics are cringy, and the beats? It's like they're stuck in 2005. Maybe I'm just too old for this nonsense."
0,"Snagged this album my bestie won't shut up about, and it's like a noise pollution party. The beats are all over the place, and the artist's voice? It's like cats fighting. Got it for the bestie, but I'm considering filing a noise complaint."
0,"So, I finally caved and watched ""Inception"" last night, and holy mind-bending rollercoaster, Batman! This movie got more layers than my grandma's lasagna. Leo DiCaprio is like the conductor of this brain-twisting symphony, and I'm over here trying to keep up like a cat chasing a laser pointer. The dreams within dreams had me questioning reality, and that ending? Bruh, I need a PhD in philosophy to unpack that. The visuals were next level – like an acid trip without the acid. The whole time, I'm thinking, ""Am I dreaming right now?"" Plus, that Hans Zimmer score is like the soundtrack to my existential crisis. I had to hit pause a couple of times just to catch my breath. Inception, more like 'Incept-my-mind-and-leave-it-spinning,' am I right?"
0,"Okay, so I finally sat my lazy butt down and watched ""Inception,"" and dang, Christopher Nolan, what kinda wizardry is this? My brain feels like it bench-pressed a truck. Leo, my man, you got me questioning reality more than my ex's breakup text. The plot twists hit harder than my grandma's wooden spoon when I tried stealing cookies. And can we talk about that hallway fight scene? It's like they slapped physics in the face and said, ""Not today."" I swear, my jaw dropped so many times; I'm surprised it's still attached. And that ending, bro, I'm still scratching my head. Did the top fall or what? I might need therapy to recover from this movie. But hey, I enjoyed every mind-f**king second of it. Nolan, you magnificent genius, take a bow."
0,"M. Night Shyamalan, what were you thinking, man? I was hyped for some epic bending battles, but all I got was a bending of my expectations into a pretzel. The acting? Let's not even go there – it's like they found these actors at a community theater next to a gas station. The CGI was more cringe than my middle school yearbook photos, and I swear the dialogue felt like a first draft from a high school drama class. I'm a huge fan of the animated series, so this movie was like a betrayal from a childhood friend. Honestly, my nostalgia feels violated. M. Night, you've officially ruined a masterpiece, and I need a refund for my time."
0,"What in the bending world did I just watch? It's like M. Night Shyamalan gathered all the worst elements of bad filmmaking, threw them into a blender, and hit puree. The pacing was slower than a snail with a hangover, and the characters had less emotion than my cat staring at a wall. And let's not even talk about the whitewashing – seriously, did the casting director even watch the cartoon? The special effects were so dated; I've seen better graphics on a '90s computer game. If I could bend time, I'd go back and warn myself not to press play. This movie is a bending disaster, and I regret every moment. M. Night, consider my childhood officially butchered."
0,"Alright, so I had the misfortune of watching this cinematic nightmare called ""Cats,"" and I genuinely feel like I used one of my nine lives enduring this monstrosity. I mean, what in the furball was Tom Hooper thinking? The CGI left me with more nightmares than a midnight scratching session. The plot? Nonexistent. It's like they threw some catnip on a script and hoped for the best. And the music? It's like they kidnapped Andrew Lloyd Webber and forced him to compose using a kazoo. The cast – A-list actors prancing around like they're in a bizarre feline fever dream. I'd rather clean a litter box for a year than suffer through this again. Someone call PETA, because these cats deserve better – and so do we."
0,"I don't know if I accidentally stumbled into a parallel universe, but I watched ""Cats,"" and my reality feels shattered. The CGI cat-human hybrids made my skin crawl more than a hairball on the carpet. I'm all for creativity, but this was like watching a fever dream after eating expired tuna. The plot was thinner than a whisker, and the musical numbers had me questioning if I accidentally joined a cult. The star-studded cast did their best cat impression, but it felt more like a dare than a performance. I've seen better cat cosplays at a Halloween party. This movie is the reason cats knock stuff off shelves – they're trying to erase any memory of this cinematic catastrophe. Steer clear unless you have a bizarre fascination with feline humanoids."
0,"Oh man, let me tell ya, this movie is like a rollercoaster ride for your emotions! I was on the edge of my seat the whole time, and I don't even have a seatbelt on my couch! The plot twists, the action scenes, and the humor had me laughing and crying in the same breath. The characters are like my new BFFs - I wanna invite them over for movie night and some pizza! The special effects? Mind-blowing! I don't know how they did it, but it looked like they borrowed some alien tech to make everything so realistic. And the soundtrack? Pure fire! I'm adding it to my playlist ASAP. The only downside is that I need a time machine now to go back and experience it all over again for the first time. If you're into heart-pounding excitement, laugh-out-loud moments, and a movie that's just plain fun, this one's a winner. Trust me, you won't regret it!"
0,"Ugh, where do I even start with this movie? It's like they took all the worst clichés from every bad film ever made and mashed them together into a hot mess. I had high hopes, but it's like the director just threw spaghetti at the wall and hoped something would stick. The plot? Don't even get me started - I've seen more coherent storylines in my grandma's grocery list. And the characters? I couldn't care less about them if I tried. They were like cardboard cutouts reading lines from a script they barely understood. I swear, my pet goldfish has more depth than the lead actor. The special effects were a joke - I've seen better graphics on my nephew's video game console. The only positive thing I can say is that the movie ended, but even then, I felt like I wasted two hours of my life that I'll never get back. Save yourself the agony and skip this one. I'd rather sit through a root canal than endure this cinematic disaster again."
0,"This movie, folks, is a masterpiece! I swear, it's like they bottled pure joy and injected it right into my eyeballs. From the opening scene to the final credits, I was hooked. The plot? A rollercoaster of emotions that left me questioning life, love, and the meaning of it all. The characters? Oh, they're not just characters; they're my new imaginary friends. I wanna grab a coffee with them and spill all my secrets! And let's talk about the special effects. Did the filmmakers secretly team up with wizards? Because what I saw on screen was downright magical. I felt like I was in the movie, not just watching it. The soundtrack? A symphony of perfection that's now the anthem of my life. I've already downloaded it, and it's on repeat. Honestly, this movie is the reason I believe in cinema's power to transport us to other worlds. If you miss this one, you're missing out on a slice of cinematic heaven."
0,"Good grief, what did I just watch? I had higher expectations for a movie, like finding a dollar on the street and then realizing it's actually a winning lottery ticket. Instead, it was more like finding a dollar and then realizing it's glued to the ground. The plot? It felt like the writers played mad libs with a high school drama script. I've seen more originality in my grandma's knock-knock jokes. The characters were as interesting as watching paint dry. I wouldn't care if they all got abducted by aliens and taken to a better movie. The special effects? I've seen better graphics on my nephew's ancient Game Boy. It's like they hired the intern to handle the CGI. And the soundtrack? I've heard more captivating tunes from a malfunctioning ice cream truck. Save yourself the trouble, folks. Don't bother with this one unless you're trying to test your pain threshold. I'd rather watch paint dry – at least it dries eventually."
0,"This book is a literary feast for the soul! The prose is so rich and vivid that I felt transported to another world with every page.

Highly recommend to anyone in need of a captivating escape."
0,"I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but this book was a snoozefest. The writing felt pretentious, and the characters were as dull as dishwater. The plot meandered without purpose, and I found myself counting the pages until it was over. If you're into sleep-inducing literature, this might be your cup of tea, but I'd rather spend my time on something more engaging."
0,"This movie is a cinematic triumph! The storytelling is gripping, the visuals are stunning, and the performances are top-notch. It's a rollercoaster of emotions that left me breathless and yearning for more. Whether you're a film buff or just looking for a great time at the movies, this one is an absolute must-see."
0,"I had high hopes for this film, but boy, was I disappointed. The plot was predictable, the dialogue cringe-worthy, and the acting felt forced. It's like they threw together a bunch of clichés and called it a movie. Save yourself the ticket price and watch paint dry – it'll be a more thrilling experience."

0,"Discovering my ancestry with 23andMe was fascinating! The detailed reports were informative, and connecting with relatives I didn't know I had was a bonus. The privacy concerns, though, gave me pause."
0,The Nintendo Switch is a gamer's dream come true. The versatility of playing on the TV or in handheld mode is fantastic. The only drawback is the lack of backward compatibility with previous Nintendo consoles.
0,"Yo, the AncestryDNA kit blew my mind! Found out I'm like 10% Viking or something – crazy, right? The breakdown of regions was spot-on, and connecting with long-lost fam was heartwarming. Just be ready for possible surprises; I discovered a few wild branches on my family tree. Overall, super cool experience!"

0,"The Fire TV Stick is my lazy-day hero. The 4K quality is legit, and the Alexa remote is basically my new BFF. Streaming is a breeze, but setup was a bit confusing – had to Google some stuff. Now, though, I'm binge-watching everything. Can't imagine life without it."
0,"Hydro Flask, you beauty! This thing is like a temperature fortress for my drinks. Ice-cold water in the desert? Check. Hot cocoa on a snowy hike? Double-check. Only gripe – it's a bit pricey. But, hey, it's an investment in hydration happiness."
0,"The Echo Dot is my new housemate. Alexa's always on point – weather, music, dad jokes, you name it. The sleek design blends right in, but sometimes Alexa thinks I said something when I didn't. Just a minor hiccup in an otherwise awesome smart speaker."
0,"Got the Fitbit Inspire 2 to guilt-trip me into moving more, and it's working! The sleep tracking blew my mind – apparently, I'm a restless sleeper. Comfortable on the wrist, but the charger is kinda finicky. Small price for health enlightenment, though."

0,"Sony's WF-1000XM4 earbuds are legit eargasmic. Noise cancellation is boss – buses, crying babies, all gone. Sound quality? A+. The only buzzkill? The case is kinda chunky, not exactly pocket-friendly. Worth it, though, for that audio bliss."

0,"Got the HERO10 for my wild adventures, and it's a beast. 5.3K video? Insane. Touchscreen is smooth, but the battery life? Meh. If you're filming an epic day, bring extra juice. Still, capturing those moments in crispy detail – priceless."

0,"Under Armour's Tech 2.0 shirt is gym royalty. Breathable, sweat-wicking – it's the real MVP during workouts. The fit's a bit snug, so if you like it roomy, size up. Otherwise, it's like a comfy second skin."
0,"Honestly, the whole doorbell thing with the camera was a mistake. It's supposed to be this fancy security gadget, but the setup was like solving a Rubik's Cube. For someone not tech-savvy like me, it was a nightmare. And let's talk about the battery life – or lack thereof. It died on me right when the delivery guy was dropping off a package. Great timing, right? Not impressed."
0,"So, the coffee maker I bought turned out to be a lot more high-maintenance than expected. It's noisy, takes up way too much counter space, and decided to glitch right before a family brunch. Imagine the horror of explaining to your in-laws why there's no coffee. Not the smooth mornings I had in mind."
0,"My fitness tracker became more like a nagging coach than a motivator. It tracked my every move and made me feel guilty for not reaching some arbitrary step goal. The sleep tracking? It basically told me I'm terrible at something I can't control. Bought it for motivation, ended up feeling like a failure. Eventually tossed it for my sanity's sake."
0,"Thought I snagged a deal with this dinnerware set, but it's been nothing but headaches. One trip to the microwave, and a plate cracked like it was made of glass. Hosting a dinner now feels like playing Russian Roulette with these dishes. Save yourself the embarrassment and invest in something sturdier."
0,"The whole robot vacuum thing turned out to be more trouble than it's worth. It gets stuck under furniture more than my cat, and the app is supposed to be user-friendly, but I beg to differ. Bought it to chill more, but I spend my evenings rescuing it from its cleaning escapades. Not exactly the relaxation I had in mind."
0,"This tiny kitchen gadget was supposed to be a time-saver, but it's just slow-cooking disappointment. The steam release is like a jet engine, scaring my cat every time. Thought it would be my culinary savior; turns out, it's just a space-hogging frustration."
0,"These headphones are like a one-way ticket to Earache City. Comfortable for a few minutes, then they become a torture device. Bought them for long flights, but they started hurting my ears after an hour. The plasticky feel and lack of noise isolation? Not exactly the audio sanctuary I imagined."
0,This blender is more of a noise machine than a health boost. It's like waking up to a construction site every morning. Cleanup is not as easy as they claim; I found residue near the blades multiple times. It's more of a headache than a health boost. Wish I invested in a quieter blender instead.
0,"This mouse was supposed to be a reliable work companion, but it turned out to be a scroll wheel disaster. It's louder than a grandma's old typewriter, disrupting every Zoom meeting. The design is boring, and the plasticky feel screams ""cheap."" Definitely not the productivity boost I was hoping for."
0,"The cast iron skillet was supposed to be my kitchen hero, but it's more like a heavy burden. The weight is no joke; it feels like I'm lifting dumbbells while cooking. Thought the pre-seasoning would make it non-stick, but everything still sticks. Cleaning it feels like a CrossFit workout. Definitely not the cooking companion I envisioned."
0,"Alright, so I snagged these wireless earbuds thinking I'd finally cut the cord. The left bud tends to go on vacation without notice, though, leaving me with an unexpectedly one-sided audio experience. The touch controls are sensitive – a bit too sensitive for my clumsy fingers. Despite the minor quirks, the charging case is decent, and when everything aligns, the sound quality is pretty on point. For someone who's not an audiophile but still wants to rock out on the daily commute, these might hit the right notes."
0,"This travel steamer was my attempt at becoming a wrinkle-free globetrotter. It's not the quickest to heat up, which can be a bit inconvenient when you're in a rush. The steam power isn't mind-blowing, but it gets the job done for quick touch-ups. My expectations may have been a tad high for a travel-size steamer, but it still manages to keep my shirts presentable without the hassle of an iron. It's become a staple in my suitcase, even with its slow-and-steady approach."
0,"Let's talk tripods. This adjustable smartphone stand is like the yoga master of the tech world – flexible but with a hint of unpredictability.

It's not the sturdiest out there, but it's got a certain charm, especially for those impromptu photo sessions."
0,"My quest for a portable espresso maker turned into a bit of a coffee adventure. This contraption requires a bit of muscle, like pumping iron for your caffeine fix. The process is not as seamless as the fancy coffee shop machines, but hey, it gets the job done.

It might not be barista-level, but for coffee enthusiasts who enjoy a bit of manual flair, it could be a quirky addition to your morning routine."
0,"These smart LED bulbs are like the tech-savvy mood ring of lighting. The app control can be a hit or miss – sometimes it feels like a high-tech wizard, other times it's just playing hard to get.

While they might not always follow your command, they add a dash of fun and a hint of unpredictability to your living space."
0,"Got this power bank hoping to be the superhero of drained batteries, but it's more like a sidekick with endurance issues. The charging speed is not breaking any records, and the capacity is more like a marathon runner than a sprinter. Took it on a road trip, and while it managed to keep my phone alive, it definitely won't be winning any power bank Olympics. For emergencies, it's reliable, but if you're expecting Flash-like speed, you might need a different sidekick."
0,"This compact umbrella is like the origami master of rain protection – folds neatly, but not without a few surprises. The folding mechanism can be a bit delicate; I've had it collapse in a sudden gust of wind. Despite its quirks, it's convenient and fits snugly in my bag, ready for those unexpected rain showers. It might not withstand a storm, but for everyday use, it's a reliable companion, folding and unfolding with a touch of whimsy."
0,"Snagged this portable speaker for impromptu gatherings, and it's more like a low-key background musician than a headlining act. The volume doesn't reach party anthem levels, but for a cozy get-together, it adds a pleasant background hum. The Bluetooth connection occasionally does a little waltz, but once synced, it delivers decent sound quality. Not exactly a concert hall experience, but it brings a casual vibe to the chill hangouts."
0,"This laptop stand was my attempt at creating a ergonomic haven for work, and it's like the yoga instructor for my laptop. Adjusting the height feels a bit like solving a puzzle, and the stand wobbles with the enthusiasm of a fitness newbie. Despite the minor instability, it does provide a more eye-level screen position, saving me from the dreaded hunchback. It's not the rock-solid fortress I imagined, but it brings a touch of flexibility to my work-from-home setup."
0,"The handheld frother became my morning ritual, promising barista-level lattes at home. It's more like a mini whirlwind in my coffee mug – airy and frothy. The foam might not rival a coffee shop's masterpiece, but it adds a touch of luxury to my homemade beverages. Using it during breakfast gatherings, it's become a bit of a conversation starter. Not exactly a coffee art maestro, but for the price, it's a playful addition to the morning routine."
0,"This robot vacuum is my domestic hero, tirelessly battling dust bunnies. It even navigated the chaos of my kid's playroom like a seasoned explorer. However, it occasionally thinks my rug is an enemy, getting stuck in a loop of confusion. Despite the rug fiasco, it's become a family favorite, silently cleaning our messes and making us feel like we're living in the future."
0,"These headphones are my sanctuary in a sea of chaos. The noise-canceling is so effective; I can pretend I'm on a deserted island instead of my daily commute. They're comfortable for hours, but the sleek design comes at the expense of durability. One clumsy drop, and they're singing their swan song. Nevertheless, for the moments of musical bliss and quiet solitude, they're worth every penny."
0,"These silicone food bags are my eco-friendly dream. Saving the planet, one sandwich at a time. They're sturdy, seal like a vault, and the colors make my fridge look like a snack rainbow. I even tried one for soup – disaster. Leakage everywhere. Lesson learned: stick to solid stuff. Despite the soupy mess, they've become my kitchen companions on the sustainable journey."
0,"This smart thermostat transformed my house into a cozy haven. The app is intuitive, and I can control the temperature with a flick of my finger. However, the installation process was like deciphering ancient hieroglyphics. It took a few calls to tech support and a dance with frustration. Now that it's set up, though, it's the ruler of my climate kingdom. If only it could make me coffee in the morning."
0,"My paddleboard adventure turned into a comedy of errors. Inflating this thing is like trying to fill a balloon with a straw – a full-blown lung workout. Once afloat, though, it glides gracefully on the water. But, the first time I tried to ride a wave, I ended up in an unintentional yoga pose – downward-facing paddle. Despite the inflatable hurdles, it's a summer joyride once you get the hang of it."
0,"This personal blender is my smoothie savior. It whips up breakfast concoctions faster than I can say ""kale."" However, it's a bit of a diva when it comes to ice; I have to coax it with a gentle shake. The portability is a game-changer, though. I took it to the office once, and my colleagues thought I was a smoothie sorcerer. It's a bit high-maintenance, but for the smoothie enthusiast, it's a worthy companion."
0,"My camping hammock adventure was a mixed bag of relaxation and confusion. It's compact, easy to set up, and the peaceful swaying is the stuff of outdoor dreams.

A bit of a learning curve, but once mastered, it's pure outdoor bliss."
0,"This instant print camera captured my heart – literally. It's like having a Polaroid time machine. However, the learning curve for shaking it like a Polaroid picture is a dance move I'm still perfecting. The photos have a vintage charm, but the ink can get a bit heavy on the wallet. Despite the expense, it's become my memory-keeper, freezing moments in time with a nostalgic touch."
0,"These resistance bands turned my living room into a makeshift gym. They're like the chameleons of exercise equipment – versatile and space-friendly. However, during an overzealous leg workout, one snapped and left a tiny welt on my thigh. A war wound, if you will. Despite the battle scars, they've become my go-to for at-home workouts, providing a solid burn without the bulky gym equipment."
0,"My portable grill experience was a backyard barbecue saga. It's compact, easy to tote, and grills like a champion. Yet, the first time I tried assembling it, I felt like I was deciphering an ancient map. Once conquered, though, it became my grilling sidekick. The size is perfect for a small gathering, but if you're expecting a feast, you might need to plan for rounds two and three. Grilling triumphs, a bit of frustration – it's the yin and yang of backyard barbecues."
0,"Let me tell you about my newfound love – the electric standing desk converter. It's not just a piece of furniture; it's a lifestyle upgrade. As someone shackled to a desk for hours, this converter has transformed my work routine. The electric adjustment is smooth as butter, allowing me to transition from sitting to standing effortlessly. The spacious surface accommodates my dual monitors and leaves room for a notepad, coffee mug, and a succulent (because who doesn't need a little greenery in their workspace?). The design is sleek and modern, blending seamlessly with my home office aesthetic. Now, let's talk about the health perks. The ability to stand during work has done wonders for my back and posture. I've even started integrating short bursts of exercise during my standing sessions. It's like having a mini gym right at my desk – talk about a productivity boost! However, assembling this behemoth was a bit of a puzzle. The instructions resembled a map written in a secret language. It took some trial and error, but eventually, I triumphed. A small hiccup in the grand scheme of ergonomic bliss. In conclusion, this electric standing desk converter is a game-changer for anyone looking to upgrade their workspace. It combines functionality with health benefits, making it a must-have for the modern desk warrior."

It captures every vocal nuance, from soft serenades to power ballad belting. The built-in echo effect adds a touch of professional flair, making me feel like I'm performing at the Grammys (in my living room, of course). The battery life is impressive. I hosted a karaoke marathon with friends, and this mic outlasted our vocal stamina. It's a party essential, compact enough to carry around, and the colorful LED lights add a disco vibe to the festivities. Now, the only minor quirk is the volume control. It's a bit touchy; a gentle tap can send the volume skyrocketing. It took some getting used to, but once mastered, it became a minor inconvenience in the grand symphony of karaoke fun. In summary, this wireless Bluetooth karaoke microphone is a karaoke enthusiast's dream. It's fun, versatile, and packs a vocal punch that can turn any gathering into a musical extravaganza."

It's like having a virtual security guard on duty 24/7. The notifications are prompt, and I can access the live feed from my phone anytime, anywhere. I had a recent incident where a neighborhood cat triggered the motion alert. Not a security breach, but it reassured me that the system is vigilant and ready to pounce into action. The only hiccup was the initial setup of the mobile app, which felt like navigating a labyrinth. A call to customer support, though, and they guided me through it step by step. A bit time-consuming, but the support team was patient and resolved my issue. In summary, this outdoor camera system is a stellar investment for anyone serious about home security. It offers peace of mind, top-notch quality, and a virtual security guard that never takes a coffee break."
0,"Meet my latest fitness companion – the compact folding treadmill. As someone juggling a hectic schedule, this treadmill has been a game-changer for my at-home workouts.

The emergency stop clip is a thoughtful touch, ensuring safety during those intense sprints. The noise level is reasonable; I can watch TV or listen to podcasts without feeling like I'm in the middle of a construction site. However, I did notice a slight belt noise after a few weeks of use.

0,"These Bluetooth earbuds are a technological tragedy. The left one has commitment issues – it disconnects randomly, leaving me in audio purgatory. Charging them is like playing a guessing game; sometimes they're charging, sometimes they're just pretending. The sound quality is as consistent as a soap opera plot twist. Save yourself the frustration and invest in a string-and-can setup – it'll probably be more reliable."
0,"This fitness tracker is a digital disaster. It thinks I'm either in a constant marathon or taking the laziest nap of my life – there's no in-between. The heart rate monitor is more creative writing than accurate data, fluctuating like a teenager's mood. The sleep tracking is a cruel joke; it claims I'm in deep sleep when I'm actually binge-watching Netflix. It's not a fitness tracker; it's a fiction writer's attempt at a health guide."
0,"I bought this non-stick frying pan, and it's more like a sticky saga. The non-stick coating is about as reliable as a politician's promises. After a week, my eggs started staging a protest, sticking to the pan like they'd formed a union. The handle gets hotter than my temper using this thing. Save yourself the frustration and go back to the dark ages of scraping pans with a chisel – it's probably less infuriating."
0,"Whoever designed this smart thermostat must have a vendetta against simplicity. The setup process is like cracking a code, and I'm no tech wizard. The Wi-Fi connection is as stable as a Jenga tower in an earthquake. It thinks I'm away when I'm clearly binge-watching my favorite shows on the couch. It's not a smart thermostat; it's a stubborn teenager refusing to follow instructions."
0,"This umbrella is a folding fiasco. The folding mechanism is a puzzle designed to test the limits of human patience. It collapses in the slightest breeze, making me question its ability to handle actual rain. I tried using it in a light drizzle, and I ended up wetter than if I'd just embraced the rain. It's not an umbrella; it's a portable rain invitation."
0,"This instant print camera is a nostalgia nightmare. The photos look like they've been through a time machine – straight from the '80s with a grainy, vintage vibe. The ink is more precious than my grandmother's china; every print feels like a financial sacrifice. The automatic flash is like a surprise party for your retinas. It's not a camera; it's a retro regret."
0,"These noise-canceling headphones are an audio apocalypse. The noise-canceling feature is more like a selective mute button – it cancels out ambient noise but leaves annoying background hums intact. The comfort level is a joke; after an hour, it feels like my ears are hosting a metal concert. The Bluetooth connection is as stable as a Jenga tower after a few rounds. Save your ears and sanity – go back to the tangled mess of wired headphones."
0,"This power bank is a portable disappointment. The charging speed is slower than a snail on sedatives, and the capacity is laughable. It's like bringing a water pistol to a firefight – cute but utterly useless. Took it on a road trip, and it barely kept my phone alive through a podcast episode. It's not a power bank; it's a powerless brick."
0,"This Bluetooth speaker is an auditory atrocity. The volume is more like a whisper, and the sound quality is reminiscent of a tin can telephone. The Bluetooth range is shorter than my attention span during a meeting. The bass is so weak; I've heard louder footsteps. Save yourself the disappointment and opt for a noisy neighbor instead – it might be more entertaining."
0,"This travel steamer is a wrinkle-inducing nightmare. It takes eons to heat up, leaving me contemplating my life choices while waiting. The steam power is more like a gentle exhale – it barely makes a dent in the wrinkles. Tried using it on a dress before a dinner date; ended up looking like I slept in it. It's not a steamer; it's a fabric dampener."
0,"This Instant Pot is the unsung hero of my kitchen. It’s like having a culinary wizard in my arsenal. The speed at which it conjures up meals is downright magical. I've experimented with everything from soups to desserts, and each time, it delivers a gastronomic masterpiece. The only drawback? My other kitchen gadgets are now collecting dust, jealous of the Instant Pot's prowess."
0,"These noise-canceling headphones are a revelation. They whisk me away to an audio oasis, drowning out the chaos of the world. The comfort is unparalleled, allowing me to lose myself in the music for hours. A word of caution, though – wear them in public, and you might miss important life events. They're not just headphones; they're a ticket to your private concert."
0,"My experience with this umbrella can be summed up in two words: utter disappointment. The folding mechanism is a conundrum, and it collapses faster than my New Year's resolutions. I thought I was investing in portable protection, but what I got was a flimsy excuse for an umbrella. Save yourself the frustration and embrace the rain – you'll get less wet without it."
0,"These Bluetooth earbuds are a mixed bag of emotions. When they work, they're music to my ears – crisp sound, comfortable fit, and a decent battery life. But the connectivity issues are infuriating. The left earbud plays hide and seek, leaving me in awkward audio limbo. It's like having a concert ticket but getting stuck in traffic – the destination is great, but the journey is a headache."
0,"This power bank is my tech lifeboat. It charges faster than my morning coffee kicks in, and the capacity is a lifesaver during travel. The sleek design fits seamlessly into my pocket, making it a daily essential. It’s not just a power bank; it’s my electronic guardian angel."
0,"The compact travel steamer was a regrettable purchase. It takes ages to heat up, and the steam power is laughable. I tried using it on a wrinkled shirt before a meeting, and I ended up looking like I wrestled with my laundry. It's not a steamer; it's a fabric dampener. Save yourself the hassle and invest in an old-school iron."
0,"These smart LED bulbs are the mood maestros of my living space. The color choices are a rainbow for every occasion, from cozy movie nights to impromptu dance parties. The app control, however, is a bit finicky. It's like having a remote control for your emotions – sometimes it works seamlessly, other times it leaves you in the dark."
0,"This laptop stand is a game-changer for my work-from-home setup. The adjustable height saves me from the dreaded hunchback, and the sleek design adds a touch of modernity to my workspace. It’s not just a stand; it’s a posture savior and an aesthetic upgrade for my home office."
0,"The handheld frother is my morning ritual in a cup. It transforms my coffee into a creamy masterpiece. The battery life is impressive, lasting through multiple frothing sessions. It’s not just a frother; it’s a coffee companion that elevates my morning routine."
0,"This portable speaker is the life of my backyard gatherings. The volume may not reach concert levels, but it adds a pleasant hum to the ambiance. The Bluetooth connection is a bit temperamental, but once synced, it delivers decent sound quality. It’s not a powerhouse; it’s a musical sidekick for those chill moments with friends."
0,"So, this pot, right? It's like a kitchen wizard or sumthin'. I throw stuff in, press buttons, and BAM, food happens. It's like magic, but in my kitchen. But the buttons, man, they're like hieroglyphics. Sometimes, I press one, and who knows what's cookin'. Food lottery, anyone? Still, it's my culinary partner in crime, even if we don't always speak the same language."
0,"These headphones are like, whoa. Noise goes bye-bye, and I'm in my bubble. But, and there's always a but, they're big. Like, take-over-your-head big. I wore them, and people thought I was auditioning for a sci-fi movie. But hey, if you wanna be the spaceman of sound, these are your intergalactic ticket."
0,"OK, umbrella, we need to talk. Folding, not your thing. It's like trying origami in a hurricane. And wind? Forget it. This umbrella's philosophy: why be an umbrella when you can be a parachute? It folds, it collapses, it's a mood. Rain protection? More like rain suggestion."
0,"Earbuds, man. Left one's a wanderer, playing hide and seek. I'm like, ""Left bud, where you at?"" And silence. It's like having a conversation with a ghost. But when they decide to play nice, the music's not bad. It's a love-hate relationship, like a musical soap opera in my ears."
0,"Power bank, my electronic sidekick. Charges stuff like a superhero, but the speed? Not Flash-level, more like a lazy turtle. Takes its sweet time. It's like, ""Come on, I got places to be!"" But it keeps my gadgets alive, so it's forgiven. Kinda like a techy butler – slow but reliable."
0,"Steamer, oh steamer. Takes ages to heat up, and the steam? More like a sigh. I tried dewrinkling a shirt, and it ended up looking like a crumpled love letter. It's like the steamer's playing a prank on my clothes. Not a steamer, more like a fabric confuser."
0,"Bulbs with moods, man! They change colors, party in the living room. But the app? It's like a disco ball – flashy, but confusing. One minute it's all rainbows, next minute, blackout. It's like the bulbs have their own party agenda. Not just bulbs; it's a light show with a side of confusion."
0,"This stand, OK? It's like a yoga instructor for my laptop. Adjustable heights, a wobbly dance. It's like, ""Find your balance, laptop!"" But hey, it saves me from the hunchback, so it's a posture savior. A bit wobbly, but aren't we all?"
0,"Frother, my morning whisk dance. It's like a mini tornado in my coffee cup. But beware, it’s a caffeine storm. The foam's a bit wild, like a frothy rebellion. Not just a frother; it's a morning rebellion in a cup."
0,"This speaker, right? It's like a chill buddy. Volume's not party level, but it's like a musical hum in the background. Bluetooth plays hard to get, a connection tango. Not a powerhouse, more like a musical whisperer for cozy hangs."
0,"This robo-vac, man, it's like having a pet with a PhD in dustology. But, it thinks my rug is a wrestling match – stuck, confused, lost. It's a dance-off between technology and the floor. Yet, it cleans my messes, like a digital superhero. Not a robo-vac; it's a dust ninja on a rug adventure."
0,"These cans, they're like ear-huggers. Noise disappears, and I'm in a silent disco, grooving to my own beat. But, they're chunky, like earmuffs from the future. Wear them, and people think you're auditioning for a sci-fi movie. But hey, if you wanna be the spaceman of sound, these are your intergalactic ticket."
0,"These silicone bags, my eco warriors. Saving the planet, one sandwich at a time. But, tried soup – leak city. A soupy disaster. It's like the bags have their own agenda. Despite the soupy rebellion, they're my kitchen comrades on a green mission."
0,"This smarty-thermo, it's a climate overlord. Controls my house like a weather wizard. But, installation? Hieroglyphics. Tech support dance, frustration tango. Now ruling my climate kingdom, just wish it made coffee. Not a smart thermo; it's a coffee-less king of temperatures."
0,"Paddleboard chaos. Inflating is like blowing up a balloon with a straw – lung Olympics. Once afloat, it's a water dance. Tried a wave – yoga fail. Inflatable hurdles, but once mastered, it's a summer joyride. Paddleboard: a floating adventure with a side of yoga."
0,"The portable blender is a reliable addition to my morning routine. While it struggles a bit with ice, the overall performance is commendable. Its portability is a key feature, making it a convenient choice for on-the-go smoothies."
0,"The instant print camera offers a nostalgic touch to capturing moments. The photos have a vintage charm, and the automatic flash is a practical feature. While the ink can be a bit pricey, the camera is a reliable memory-keeper for special occasions."
0,"The resistance bands set provides a versatile solution for at-home workouts. While one band snapped during an intense session, the overall quality is decent. It's a compact and space-friendly alternative to traditional gym equipment."
0,"The compact portable grill is a practical choice for small gatherings. While the assembly process can be a bit challenging, the grilling performance is satisfactory. It's a suitable option for those who prioritize convenience over a large cooking surface."
0,"The multifunctional Instant Pot is a time-saving kitchen appliance. It simplifies cooking processes and significantly reduces preparation time. While the learning curve for the control panel exists, online resources make it accessible for users seeking a variety of cooking options."

0,"This gaming console is a portable nightmare. The screen is tiny, and the controllers are like playing with Barbie accessories. Late-night battles? More like late-night regrets. Mario on the bus? Mario, please stay at home."
0,This e-reader is a digital disaster. The warm light is more like a lukewarm disappointment. One-handed reading? Try one-handed frustration. It's not a book replacement; it's a digital downgrade.
0,This vinyl album is a noisy relic. Pops and crackles like a microwave on the fritz. Each track is a reminder of the past – and not in a good way. The needle drop is like a slap in the face from the '80s.
0,"This camera is a picture-perfect disappointment. No more blurry pics? Well, now they're just clear disappointments. Stabilization is a myth, and using it feels like I'm holding a brick. Family photographer? More like family letdown."
0,"Catan, the game that ruins friendships. Trading bricks and sheep? More like trading trust for betrayal. Roads and settlements? Try roads to nowhere. Game night MVP? More like Most Vexing Problem."
0,These ear things are a vibration disaster. Music in my cheekbones? More like a dental appointment gone wrong. Running with them is a jog through auditory agony. Ear invasion? These headphones are an invasion of common sense.
0,Read this book – if you enjoy confusing dreams. Magic circus and duels? It's like reading Shakespeare on acid. Stepping into a fantasy world? More like stepping into literary quicksand. A literary wizard? More like a confused apprentice.
0,"This box of building blocks is an adult Lego nightmare. Eiffel Tower, Statue of Liberty – it's like constructing disappointment one brick at a time. Connecting them is a puzzle without a solution. Architect of my world? More like architect of regrets."
0,"Keyboard with lights – because why type in peace? Mechanical clicks? More like annoying clacks that could drive you to madness. RGB colors change with my mood? Well, my mood is officially annoyed. It's not a keyboard; it's a typist's torture device."
0,"This notebook with a leather cover is a writing disaster. Scribbling thoughts feels pretentious, like I'm auditioning for a literary award. Private conversation with myself? More like a solo act in a theater of self-doubt. It's not just paper; it's a reminder of regrettable purchases."
0,"This robo-vac is my little cleaning sidekick. Bought it to save me from the monotony of vacuuming, and it's been a game-changer. It dances around the living room like a miniature janitor. The cat's fascinated, and I'm free from the tyranny of pet hair. Best purchase for lazy clean freaks like me!"
0,"These headphones were a splurge gone wrong. Thought they'd be my sanctuary from office noise, but the noise canceling is more like noise suggestion. Gave them a shot during a cross-country flight, and they felt like earmuffs from a bad '80s movie. Maybe I'll gift them to my annoying neighbor – they deserve each other."
0,"Got these silicone bags for a green kick in the kitchen. The idea was to ditch plastic, but reality check – they're not soup-friendly. Spilled chili in the fridge was not the eco-friendly masterpiece I envisioned. They're okay for sandwiches, but my journey to reduce waste hit a few bumps."
0,"The smart thermostat saved my utility bill. Bought it for the cool factor, but the energy savings were a pleasant surprise. It's like a temperature wizard, adapting to my habits. Programmed it to warm up before I stumble out of bed – cozy mornings without the financial chill."
0,"The inflatable paddleboard turned my summer into an aquatic adventure. Bought it impulsively for a beach trip, and it's become a weekend ritual. Paddling on the lake, feeling like a water explorer – it's my instant vacation. Note to self: always trust impulsive Amazon buys."
0,"Bone conduction headphones – a mixed bag. Bought them for jogging, thinking they'd be my rhythm buddies. Turns out, they're more like auditory gymnastics. If you enjoy feeling the beat in your cheekbones, these are for you. Not a total win, but they add a weird element to my workout playlist."
0,"This folding umbrella is a comedy of errors. Bought it for a sudden rainstorm, and it collapsed faster than my hopes for a dry commute. The wind resistance is a cruel joke. Now, I only use it as a makeshift fashion accessory. It's not an umbrella; it's a wet fashion statement."
0,"The adjustable laptop stand is my WFH savior. Bought it to save my neck from the laptop hunchback, and it delivered. It's like having an ergonomic angel on my desk. Now, I can pretend to be a posture guru during Zoom calls. Aesthetically pleasing and back-friendly – double win."
0,"This frother is my secret to gourmet coffee at home. Bought it to level up my morning routine, and it's a latte game-changer. The battery life is impressive – froths through multiple cups without a hiccup. It's not just a frother; it's my daily dose of coffee luxury."

0,"My experience with this electronic reader has been less than stellar. While the concept promised a literary revolution, the touch screen often feels unresponsive and glitchy. Rather than enhancing the reading experience, it tends to hinder it, leaving me frustrated during what should be a leisurely escape."
0,"The automated cleaning companion I welcomed into my home is a bit of a mixed bag. While it handles day-to-day dust with ease, its struggle with corners and edges leaves room for improvement. It's like a diligent intern – great at basics but lacking finesse. Not a cleaning maestro, but it gets the job done."
0,"These headphones are a true marvel in noise-canceling technology. They create a symphony of silence, providing a portal to auditory serenity. Comfortable, stylish, and boasting impeccable sound quality, they are more than just headphones; they are an escape to a world of undisturbed audio."
0,"Despite promises of fitness tracking excellence, my experience with this device was underwhelming. While step counting proved accurate, the heart rate monitor left much to be desired, providing inconsistent readings during workouts. A fitness companion should inspire confidence, not guesswork."
0,"This powerful kitchen tool has become my go-to for culinary adventures. It effortlessly crushes ice, pulverizes fruits, and conducts a symphony of smoothie-making. It's more than just a blender; it's a kitchen virtuoso, turning every recipe into a culinary masterpiece."
0,"Adding this wireless charger to my desk has been a modest convenience. It accomplishes its primary task – charging my phone without the hassle of cables. However, the charging speed feels more like a slow dance than a sprint. It's not groundbreaking, but it reliably serves its purpose."
0,These headphones by a renowned brand have exceeded my expectations. The noise-canceling capabilities transport me to an auditory sanctuary in the midst of a bustling world. Intuitive touch controls and marathon-worthy battery life make them more than just headphones; they provide an immersive audio escape.

0,"The promise of heightened home security turned into disappointment with this video doorbell. Connectivity issues and inconsistent video quality have transformed the potential peace of mind into a buffering nightmare. The installation process felt more like an engineering exam, making this a regrettable addition to my smart home endeavors."
1,just like No-Limit Cash Money has no shame at putting out garbage music.wack beats and no lyric ryhmes.who is buying this crab? all the stuff sounds the same and it's not that average.it's all bad.
1,"i like the Hot Boys and really like Juvenile, but this is not good. the only thing good is ""we on fire"" and ""I need a hot girl"". just download those 2 songs onto your Ipod and skip this album."
1,"Guerriula Warfare is an album I fell is something, and that something is everything. The lyrics are most of the time meanless and pointless. Also the beat and backround music of the songs sometimes don't even fit could for the lyrics or how the rapper is rapping. Overall please go out and get another Hotboy album or something. Or just another album in the lines of Cash Money, just please not this one..."
1,"This is the second best Cash Money album I've ever heard next to Juvenile's 400 Degreez which is definetely a 5 Star cd too. The Hot Boys put out an album with like 5 or 6 really strong songs. And as bunch of other average or a little better songs. Not really any horrible songs at all. The Best Songs are the main 4 ""I Need A Hot Girl"", ""We On Fire"", ""Respect My Mind"" & ""Tuesday & Thursday"". Those 4 songs were the songs I listened to every morning for like months and months. And i have over 200 cd's! So this cd must be good huh? ""Ridin'"" is another real tight one! Then the other songs all blend in with the rest like ""Clear Tha Set"" by Lil'Wayne. ""Ya Dig"" by Juvenile. ""Help"" by B.G., and ""Bout Whatever"" by Turk. I Think it's cool that all of them got there own solo songs. ""Too Hot"" is nice too..along with the rest of the songs. Juvenile, B.G., Turk & Lil'Wayne put out one of the best cd's of '99, and also the best group cd to come out for a long while!It's real good!"
1,"A continuation of the illest hip-hop album in recent times, 400 degreez. If you aren't down w/ C.M.B yet, go get 400 degreez first. If you already got and you love it, this is just another hour of banging bump and car music. Great"

1,"At first I was disappointed that this wasn't a longer book, but then I realized that it is great to give away to curious friends and parents as an introduction to Love and Logic. I just wish it was a little cheaper."
1,"This is a book for all parents or parents to be, all people thinking of having children. Love and Logic is a program to help you be a more effect parent, raising responsible children. It can also be used on co workers and the rest."
1,"If you've ever eaten at the wonderful restaurant Antoine's in the French Quarter of New Orleans (with its many themed Mardi Gras private rooms), you will definitely enjoy this book. And even if you haven't eaten at Antoine's, if you're interested in New Orleans society mid-way through the 20th Century, you'll find this a delightful mystery.In addition, the home of the late author, Frances Parkinson Keyes, is open to the public in New Orleans. It's actually called the Beauregard Keyes House after Confederate General Beauregard who stayed there and Frances Parkinson Keyes. And the author also wrote a novel about the house called ""Madame Castel's Lodger,"" which is filled with the interesting history of General Beauregard.-- Phyllis Zimbler Miller"
1,"This beautifully written novel in a gently used library copy now joins my little shelf of Unlimited Re-Reads reserved for just such special old friends as The Virginian, Until the Sun Falls, O the Brave Music, A Dance to the Music of Tim, Persuasion and The Final Reflection. The words are worn smooth by familiarity and give the pleasure of fingering a stash of precious stones. Dinner at Antoine's is also touching as a memory of New Orleans in a former time among the privileged classes, with a sunny certainty that nothing will ever change (it is set in January-February 1948)."
1,"I should have paid closer attention to the size of this horse when I ordered it, but it should not be in the ride-on section. It is clearly not a ride on toy. It is tiny. The beanie babies ride on this horse and fit perfect. All it is is a stuffed horse on wheels and it is so tiny. My kids never play with it. This was a learning lesson for me with shopping online."
1,"I find this book highly useful as a desktop reference for just about anything HTML/DHTML related. In addition, Powell does a great job of introducing topics that may be new to some people, like XML."
1,"I needed a comprehensive, intelligent guide covering HTML, DHTML, CSS etc. This book provides that and more in a easy to understand manner, that isn't too simplistic for an advanced web author. A smart layout, and nice index helps you locate what you need fast. Color charts, CSS style references, tag attributes a-plenty, DHTML overviews and in-depth information is there when you need it. If you're looking to spend on a clever guide to take you into the ever expanding world of web technologies, this book is a excellent resource!"
1,"Many parts of this book are difficult to understand for the beginning and intermediate user. It is an informative, advanced reference; the only one needed for an experienced website creator. There are no color examples of what the HTML language produces, making some of it difficult to piece together if you are not experienced."
1,"I am a system analyst with IBM background, client server is totally new for me and being a novice in this area I found this book of immense help. The topics have been beautifully explained. HTML, XML, CSS,DHTML are no longer nightmares for me. I must say that from day one itself I started writing HTMLs. This book is simply great for anybody who would like to learn about HTML. I would recommend this books to beginners as well as experts for reference. The book is worth buying. This is worth 5+ star rating."
1,"Well although i found the book to be extremely informative and I learned a great deal from it, I was very disapointed that I could not get a lot of the examples to work for me. I am not talking about the images but the actual pages did not come up the way the way the book depicts them if you type them in exactly the way it is printed. I had to tweek them a bit to make them work correctly. I fell that I am going to have to go elsewhere to find the right type of book for me. Other than that the book did have a lot of information to give and will keep it as a reference as the book's title plainly details."
1,"It is a great book for all new arrivals to the Web development and design world. The book's title doesn't indicate the real content, it is not just HTML, it is an introduction to web design covering HTML, JavaScript, Client-Programming, Server-Programming, CSS, XML, and many other topics. I recommend it to all beginners but wishing to become experts."
1,I like the Solaray Brand. I am not allergic to it. Vitamin D-3 was recommended by my doctor. The Vitamin D-3 keeps me healthy.
1,"Excellent novel about cultural/generational borderlands and the search for personal identity. Tells the story of three marginalised young outcasts who forge a strong bond of friendhip that helps see them through various life dramas. Teo is a highly intelligent writer who makes you care about her characters, she is also excellent at evoking the flavour of various cultures in her writing. A thought provoking tale of borders, boundaries and coming of age in the cultural melting pot of contemporary Australia, told with plenty of wit and heart."
1,"The thing that most people don't understand about the FFVI sound track is that it couldn't possibly sound the same as the game. When people buy it they are expecting the exact same music and they heard while playing it, but it just wouldn't be done. On the original SNES system that this game was made for it had a very poor sound quality system in it. It was only about 16 bits if even that much. Nobody would want to listen to the poor quality music that the game produced when they could hear it orchestrated and remastered like the future FF Series games had. All in all i thought that this sound track was an excellent portrayal of the way the music should have sounded, had the game been placed on a CD based system instead of a 16 bit SNES cartridge system."
1,"I got this throat spray in a hurry hoping to relieve my 3.5 yo daughter from a bad sore throat. It tastes awful, and it's just not meant for a young child. I got it after a recommendation from another mom, and it was a bad decision. I'll keep it to numb a scratched-up knee or elbow."
1,"the glider got here much sooner than I thought, it arrived in great shape and all the pieces were there. I put it together by myself even if the kept saying 2 people. It was not hard and directions were simple.. It's really nice"
1,The bench is very nice. I had a few pieces that looked like they were painted over scratches and some of the metal were scratched. I was unsure of some of the screws as you can not tighten it too much or is strips the plastic. wasnt sure on the indents on the metal bars which way they were suppose to go on. the bench broke after sitting on it three times. The glider bar broke. the weld is not very good or sturdy.
1,"We needed to replace a wooden glider that we had in front of our house and after looking around and not really finding what we were looking for our son suggested we check Amazon.com. We chose this one because we felt it would last for a long time and the size was right. When we received it we put it together and it was very easy to assemble. The movement of the glider is smooth. The color is a little blah, but we added a couple of colorful pillows and have received many compliments on it. The price is great and we are very happy with our purchase!"
1,"Chair is the product ordered, however it came with gauges in the arms. The chair was well packed and the damage appeared to have happened at the factory before wrapping for shipment. Poor quality control. Not worth returning the product. Other than that, the bench is substantial and as promised. I have pictures taken while I was unwrapping, but couldn't figure out how to include them."
1,"Good quality and fairly easy to assemble, although it helps to have 2 people. It is quite comfortable and looks nice."
1,"Right after I clicked the purchase button for this, I remember wondering what the heck I was doing buying a glider bench off the internet. It was so reasonably priced compared to the ones I had checked out in stores, I figured I was getting some flimsy, poorly made item. But this bench is awesome! My husband put it together in about 30 minutes by himself and it's sturdy but light enough that I can drag it around our backyard to catch the sun (or not). It has held up to all the wet weather we've had, it's easy to clean and glides beautifully. It really is a quality product - I'm thinking of buying a second one for our patio."
1,"James Moody, and his well known ""cast of characters"" have put together an awsome sample of what can be done when you think everything else has already been done... I really enjoy listening to this up and coming jazz artist because he has a style that is all his own. I play this CD everytime I am trying to impress someone...and it never fails to do the job. There are some really great songs in new styles that consistantly perk up my friends ears when they hear it. They know that song, but they've ""never heard it played like THAT before""."
1,"I am a huge fan of Seal's first 3 albums, so I rushed out to buy this one the minute it came out. What a disappointment!! Most of the songs sound like old remixes of Curtis Mayfield tunes. The only 2 with that eerie signature 'Seal' sound are 'heavenly' and 'tinsel town'. I'd say go to Itunes....listen to the songs...buy the tunes you like (if there are any) and call it a day."
1,"I purchased this book hoping to find some history of the town that one of my ancestors Samuel Richardson, helped found. Although there was little mention of people from my direct line, this was an extremely interesting read of the history after the town was founded in 1630. The history and characters are real and the various chapter authors did an excellent job of researching facts and putting them into facinating stories. This book gave me a better understanding of what several generations went through in order to make Woburn what it is today. This would be a great read for anyone interested in the early history of the United States."
1,"The idea behind God was in this Place and I, i did not know it is excellent. Take the famous line from Jacob at Beth-el, and see how it has been interpreted throughout the ages by various Jewish worthies. In the process, have them talk to Jacob in a kind of free form midrash, unshackled by time. And since the writer is Rabbi Lawrence Kushner, add a bit a personal reflection and home grown stories.All the elements are here, but the book never gets off the ground. In juggling so many elements in so short a space, Kushner gets lost, and the book lacks a real sense of forward momentum or thrust. This would have been a good idea for two, maybe even three books. Kushner would have then allowed himself the luxury of exploring some of the very good themes he has laid down here and not fully explored."
1,"Wonderful video, very comical and loved by kids, also teaches some good Biblical truths and good gospel songs."
1,"The average work about socialism talks about such dry topics as economics and politics. This essay doesn't do any of that. It goes into art, and even pseudo-psychology (one could say). It covers a broad variety of topics in a short amount of pages. I agree with almost everything said in this book. It's definitely worth reading and will really make you think."
1,This is probably the best essay I have ever read. It has defined my political reviews still today. It's a work of true romanticism.
1,"Although the title is the soul of man under socialism, the theoretical basis for what he talks about would be more of a collective anarchy commune which fosters his individualism more than the socialisms that we have seen in theory and practice in the last couple of centuries.This is an interesting little essay because of its meandering nature. it starts out as a political tract, then veers into a brief on aesthetics and then tries to synthesize the two at the end. For me, its process felt unsuccessful, but at least there are many places that can be quotable.Quotable -- to the point that I wanted to, in a half-hearted daydream, to imagine using this text as a theoretical basis to look at Wilde's own creative work to see if he meets his own aesthetic standards. While that project may not be worthwhile, the reading of this essay is worthwhile."
1,"Shah Rukh Khan is my favorite actor. I enjoy seeing Rani Mukerji paired with him. This film was well done. It showed some of the difficulties couples might face after marriage. One thing that stood out to me, which bothered me, was that the ""in-laws"" of Rani's character seemed prejudiced against Shah Rukh Khan's character. I believe that once a family member has married someone, the rest of the family should be respectful and supportive of that choice and welcome and love the new spouse. Most romantic films focus on the relationship up until marriage, with the idea that the couple will live ""Happily Ever After"". However, the reality is that relationships need to be cared for after marriage. And this film gives a glimpse into the reality of marriage."
1,"This is one of my favorite bollywood movies. If you're a fan of Shahrukh Khan or Rani Mukerji you'll love this movie. It's interesting too in that it goes beyond the usual pretty love story. Where a lot of movies consist of ""boy meets girl, boy woos girl, boy and girl get married"" this movies looks at the question of ""then what?"" I know some people have complained about the bickering in the second half, but I didn't think it was that excessive. The movie just portrays the usual silly arguments and misunderstandings that couples face.I'd give the movie five stars but this particular product gets only 4 stars for the DVD quality. It's definitely pixilated in parts, not the best quality picture. Still watchable, and I wouldn't return it, but wish the picture was a bit better."
1,"If you want to watch a movie where a couple meets, falls in love, gets married, almost breaks up, have cat fights, get angry, make up, has new problems, lie to each other, hurt each other again, almost break up, really do break up, cry, yell at each other, cry again, then finally make up because there's not really anything else to do - then this is the movie for you.If you do, for some reason, decide to watch this, watch it to the point where they get married -THEN TURN IT OFF (being bollywood, thats about the length of a regular movie anyway)."
1,"We few, we lucky few, who must endure the Praxis II Practices of Learning & Teaching Test will find no guide here.There is a brief discussion of the structure of the test, and some sample questions, yes, but the content of the test is not discussed at all outside the sample question. I would have loved to see a literature or concept review, such as is found in almost every other test guide on the planet.Also, it seems the PRAXIS II went from a five-response to a four-response test at some point, and the authors responded by chopping answer E off all the sample questions, without checking whether or not that was the correct answer. In other words, they revised the questions, but did not revise the answers. Most frustrating.In all, I found this book a sorry excuse for a test guide, and recommend it for nothing except mulching, or perhaps kindling."
1,"I have waited nearly four months for this album and the wait is finally over, it's a good little album, show casing the many talents of this great metal band. It's not left hand path or wolverine blues material (both albums are in a league of their own, respectively) but for a moment just try to forget about the past work of entombed and listen to this like u are listening to them for the first time, I know that it is hard though. I recommend for the metal maniacs, entombed's new album, ""uprising"". I have owned it for about 2 weeks and it gets better with each listen, one for the collection. Entombed are the greatest band in the whole world...Cheers!"
1,"My children and I love the little Critter books. This is a great book, but it was not bound well. The book fell out of the cover within a few days of recieving it."
1,"Miss Jordan always had a special attitude for the bass, the bass lines she uses to play with singing in a group. As much as Anita O'Day used to do whith drums, Sheila Jordan has the unique ability to express herself in a clear, witty and unique way, scatting or singin words, talking and exchanging suggestions with the acoustic bass player. This is the second, according to my knowledge, and probably one of the very best of her duo recordings. A must for jazz fans and listeners keen to jazz singers with an instrumental attitude."
1,"This pedal is cheaply made but it sounds terrific, makes even a cheap organ sound half decent.It really does give you that Leslie effect if you mess around with the settings a little.It smells of burnt rubber as it is cheaply made but apart from that, I would highlyrecommend it for a keyboard but not much use for a guitar really. The price is good forwhat you get as with all Danelectro effect pedals. I received mine through Jax Music Supply, LLCwho were great to deal with, for a fast and reliable service."
1,"This book was awesome. A fast paced, riveting novel by an author I am coming to find just CANNOT disappoint me. I am hooked on her Carpathians and now find that I will run just as fast to the bookstore when her next gothic comes out.THE SCARLETTI CURSE is a terrific love story and mystery set in a supposedly cursed castle that has everything from grinning gargoyles to an impressive maze. The hero and heroine are just as riveting in their fascinatin for each other and then their entanglement in the mystery of THE SCARLETTI CURSE. I highly recommend this book to all readers, Feehan fan or not. But be warned, by the time you turn the last page of this book you will be hooked on Christine Feehan."
1,"OH MY,OH MY,SHE HAS DONE IT AGAIN.TO THE ONES THAT HAVE MS.FEEHAN'S OTHER BOOKS YOU NEED NO INTDUCTION, TO HER FINE WORK.TO THE ONES THAT DON'T KNOW ABOUT HER DARK SERIES .THIS IS A GOOD BOOK TO GET TO KNOW ABOUT MS.FEEHAN WORK.NICOTETTA AND GIOVANNI STORY IS SO POWERFUL,THAT YOU DON'T WANT THIS BOOK TO END,ONLY LOVE AND MAGIC COULD KEEP THEM AT EACH OTHER SIDE.A KEEPER .....4 STARS"
1,"Wonderful book! Very few fans of Feehan's Dark series seem to realize that although this book is not part of the Dark series, is the children and children's children of this couple will tie in to the Dark series later. Bryon's lifemate will come from this line. But if you want to learn about what's going to happen in the future books in this series as well as the Dark series, then go to Feehan's web page. You can use any search engine to get to it. But this book really is wonderful! It can really stand on it's own! I can't wait for more from this author. The publishing company needs to publish her stuff quicker than this! Can't wait till Darius's story, Dark Fire! Feel free for anyone to e-mail with any questions! I'll sell you on these books!"
1,"The heroine, Nicoletta is the village healer. Overlord Don Giovanni exercises his right to select a village girl as his bride and chooses Nicoletta against her wishes. His home, the Palazzio, is a foreboding place, mysterious and frightening to the villagers...a place with a history of death. Giovanni is able to communicate with Nicoletta mind to mind...the only similarity to the Dark Series Heroes...bringing a subtle sensuality to their burgeoning relationship...a welcome change from the ""pounce on each other in the first chapter"" genre. Feehan continues to bring us dark heroes and independant heroines who find love in the sharing of each others gifts."
1,"I have really enjoyed Ms. Feehan's Dark series, so was eager to read her new book. This is a true gothic with just enough paranormal elements to help build a relationship between the hero and heroine. Nicoletta has special ""gifts"" which her entire village tries to keep a secret, however, it is the presence of these gifts which draws Don Scarletti to her. He has ""gifts"" of his own. Nicoletta isn't immediately enchanted with the idea of marriage to the Don. Unlike some authors, who use the ""I hate you!"" temper tantrum to ignite passion between the main characters, Ms. Feehan uses the empathy and sensitivity of her characters to achieve it. The love scenes are wonderful, though not very plentiful. So if you're looking for the same amount and intensity of love scenes as in the Dark books, you may be dissappointed. I read this in one sitting and couldn't put it down. The story is riveting."
1,"Before I begin, let me just say that I absolutely love her Dark series. Those books are great. This one had potential, but it just fell flat. Her characters simply weren't developed enough this time for me to relate to them. This effort was decent but not at all up to her usual standards."
1,"This book was a major disappointment. It was missing that special spark that made Ms Feehan's other novels (especially Dark Desire) something special. I found the book had very little action, little romance, and a ""mystery"" plot that was never very mysterious or suspenseful. This is definitely not a book that I will pass on to my friends and family to read."
1,"While I don't consider it the best of Ms. Feehan's books that I have read, The Scarletti Curse is an intriguing story that is very solid. The protaganists are believable and interesting. If you like Ms. Feehan's books I can recommend this one as an addition to your library."
1,"I Loved this book. Heart pounding romance and action, keep you going though the whole storie. I say this is a Must Read!"
1,"This book had great potential that it did not live up to. I hope she goes back to writing more ""Dark Series"" books. This book needed more action and more editing - it was way too long for the amount of plot it had. :-("
1,"I absolutely couldn't stand this book!I'm not understanding how it's sexy for a woman to give up her friends and life for a guy who wishes to control her completely. The Don was a jerk. Nicoletta is an awesome heroine in the beginning, but turns into a submissive wifey thing by the end. It's a sad thing when a woman, to paraphrase an actually part of Nicoletta's thoughts, ""leaves her old life behind because he'll never like it, and because she just HAS to"". Eeeeew.I loved the Dark series, and constantly used to stalk the bookstore waiting for the next one. This one was the beginning of the end of my love for Ms. Feehan's work. I bought it to tide me over from one Dark book to the next, and it made me so angry that I wrote the author and got into a big argument over the book!Please, please, please...read something in the Dark series, or Emma Holly's Upyr series. You'll be a lot happier."
1,i was really disappointed with this book. The other ones that she has wrote were very good but this one was dull. it was as if she rushed to put a new book out and didn't take the time to make it interesting. i would still read other books that she writes but i wouldn't read this one again.
1,I first found Christine Feehan's work through 'Dark Prince'. It was an excellent read and has had me hooked on the whole series! I thought this book would be the same - not even close. The Scarlatti Curse is humdrum. Before I reached halfway I really didn't care about the characters. The secondary characters were underdeveloped and the main characters were two dimensional. I also did not get a feeling for the period or the place. In short it seemed like a short story plot that was enlarged to take advantage of her success with the Carpathian series. Please Christine don't write any more like this.
1,"I'm not a gothic reader but i bought this book because i'm a big fan of Christine Feehan.I enjoyed this book very much,it had alot of suspense, paranormal and of course romance. The plot was great,i got hooked from the begining. My only question was it did not reveal how the Scarletti brothers got their gift. Christine Feehan did an excellent job and i'm looking forward for her next book,well done."
1,CHRISTINE HAS DONE IT AGAIN... THIS BOOK IS AS GOOD AS HER DARK SERIES... WITH JUST ANOUGH SUPERNATURAL ELEMENT - TO SPARK THE INTEREST... OF THOSE PARANORMAL ROMANCE LOVERS. IN HER USUAL STYLE THE CHARACTERS ARE IMMOTIONALY BOUND AND KEEP YOU READING ON AND ON IN ONE SITTING - WITH A CLIMATIC ENDING THIS BOOKS KEEPS YOU QUESSING RIGHT TILL THE END...TRUE GOTHIC WITH CREEPY HOME - WEIRD RELATIVES AND ODD SERVANTS.. I LOVED IT... AND WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED.... CAN'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT GOTHIC - OR ANY OF HER DARK SERIES FOR THAT MATTER.. WELL DONE..
1,The Scarletti Curse is absolutely wonderful. Ms. Feehan once again created a lively well written work that stand far apart from her Dark series (which I also adore). With complex and dark characters this book has quite a lot of bite and more than enough romance for a true fan of Christine's work. I highly recommend this book for one and all.
1,"Christine Feehan does it again, for all of you that have only read this one book by her, i strongly suggest that you read them all!"
1,"First, let me say, I'd heard that I might find the Dark Series of Christine Feehan's my cup of tea and for some unknown reason, thought this was one in the series - no need to tell you, I was severely disappointed (and confused).This book really reminded me of the romances my Mother used to read back in the 70's - blech! Lots of dark male broodiness, all written from the heroines point of view, and of course she's a young innocent virgin._____________edited to add: I really wish I had only given this one star, but it appears I can't change that now."
1,"I really like Christine Feehan. This book was very dissapointing. The plot had promise. Nicoletta was a sweet heroine. The prose were good, and the medival Italy setting was an interesting change of pace. However, the plot flows like molasses in January. I managed to get half way through before I through the book down and went back to the 'Dark' series."
1,"I've had the camcorder for a while now, and was hoping to be able to use the USB streaming feature to make small computer movies and send them to my friends and family overseas. Although the camcorder is good the included software is weak and the USB streaming makes a very choppy poor quality AVI file. I recently got a new computer and could not find the device driver disk that came with the camcorder. Sony technical support was a joke and they ended up trying to sell me a driver for my camcorder. So now I have a camcorder that I can plug into my TV or record onto a VHS (Do people still use VHS?) but any dreams I have of putting something on my computer are fading fast. I'm going to have to find a new way to send my parents the video I took of my new house.Frankly in this day and age an analogue camcorder is a waste of money."
1,"Just as promised, worked well for what I needed. I have some old 8mm tapes and needed a camcorder to play them back on and this fit the bill it also had the USB streaming so I can now transfer them to dvd also the shipping was quick and package great for protection."
1,"The picture on this camera is good and it needs very little light. However, the colors are not quite as accurate as I had hoped for Hi8. Perhaps digital would have been better, but the price was a factor. I shopped around and found Amazon had the best price available."
1,"I bought it new in 2002 for $400. The color is pretty good. The resolution is very poor, only close shot get you satified. Other than that you get blur edge and barrel distortion sometimes. I didn't use it a lot for the first 3 years, only the last 2 years I used it regularly to tape my daughter's piano class homework every 2 weeks for 5-8 minutes each time. Recently I have to knock this camera extremly hard several times to make the recording start (It's common issue as the piano teacher told me.). So I have to find a new camcorder now. I don't know what can I do if it refuses to work one day in my daughter's piano class."
1,"My one-year-old has played with this toy for several months. He disregards the keys and pulls up on the lids themselves. Not quite what I expected. He's had more fun pulling the lids up and pushing them down again, and only accidentally happens upon the moving keys and the noises they make. The sounds alternate between giggles with music background and animal noises, also not quite what I expected. But it's noise I can deal with. The volume can be adjusted or turned off (through I myself can't distinguish between ""soft"" and ""loud"" on this thing). My son enjoys the toy, but it may be of limited or intermittent interest."
1,My 11 month old son received this for Christmas and he loves it. He loves to watch the animals pop up and make noises. It's fun to watch his face light up and hear him squeel with delight when he hits one of the buttons and the animal pops up.
1,Cruel and Unusual is the first Patricia Cornwell book I have got read and I for one loved it and I can't wait the read more of her books my boyfriend told me about Patricia Cornwell books he said I need to read Hornet's Nest and Southern Cross and those will be my next two book I will be reading and I will be reading them on my new IPad I got for Christmas I can't wait keep up the great writing Patricia and thanks to my boyfriend for telling me about this awesome writer.........RKsbabydoll
1,"I bought this book used and it was in very good condition. Also, I received it within a week, which was nice."
1,"I listened to the audio version of ""Cruel & Unusual"" on a recent trip to New Jersey and back. The first 2/3 of the book kept me on the edge of my seat, then... the whole thing collapsed in a heap at the end. Would have been much better if the author had stuck to writing a taut thriller instead of trying to drag in everything from evil Republican office holders to Nazi war criminals, all dumped into the mix at the last possible moment. After all the buildup, the ""who"" of the whodunnit ends up being... nobody in particular. And the fate of the evildoer? Nothin' much. Disappointing. Won't bother with Dr. Scarpetta or Ms. Cornwall again.I'm a little baffled by all the reviews that say, ""great book, bad ending..."" and still give it 3 stars or more. Isn't a mystery DEFINED by the ending, by how the author ties up all the loose ends and red herrings?"
1,"This book was a bit more difficult to follow, in my opinion. I was lost toward the end. But Patrica is an awesome writer! I'm sure the problem was me, not her writing."
1,You have to love the Scarpetta series by Cornwell. This is an excellent story full of suspense and humor.
1,"Here is a summary of my impressions:1 It was written for about the 6th grade level.2 There was virtually no ""grab"" for the first 2/3 of the book. I simply trudged through. That is highly unusual for a crime book.3 The author went into excruciating detail about extraneous subject matters. This happened multiple times. You'll feel as though she was just trying to fill pages.4 But most of all, there was no closure to the story in any satisfying way. That is paramount in a good crime book.In summary, don't bother. If you do, you'll be asking the same thing I did, ""I want my 10 hours back that I wasted on this book.""Harris LevinCruel and Unusual: A Kay Scarpetta Novel"
1,"My first foray into this writer was her latest book, Scarpetta. I enjoyed it....so I purchased this effort and several others she had written. I was a bit disheartened to find that all of her books have basically the same formula and character studies. After a while reading her work becomes less than stimulating. It becomes trite."
1,"I must say I was required to read this book for a class. If that had not been the case, I would have put the book down half way through it. I was put off by the excessive amounts of technical language and graphic descriptions of the state of murder victims. Quite frankly, I was very disappointed by this book."
1,"A typical Patricia Cornwell fiction novel, easy to read and a page turner. It gripped me until the end. Enjoy."
1,"In a word, Lacking. Her style of writing left me unable to appreciate the underlying story which, as a result, I found rather vacuous and inauthentic. So much so that I felt compelled to come write a review of this book so others might avoid making the same mistake I did. No offence Patricia."
1,"I needed to replace a lost CD set of the library CD book: Cruel and Unusual by Patricia Cornwell. The one I ordered from Amazon was listed as a CD set (not as a cassette set) so I ordered it. I received a Cassette set of the book and NOT a CD set of the book. I wrote (through Amazon) to the seller and their reply was that I received a CD set.The Librarians can vouch for what I received as I showed them the envelope and the contents within it. Even though it was my responsibility to replace the CD book (so I wouldn't have to pay the Library charge), I now had to give that job to the library. Need I say more?This time, and it's the first time, Amazon has a very disgruntled customer.Thanks for asking for the review. Maybe Amazon could check into this and prevent others from experiencing what I experienced.Sincerely,Sherry BohmP.S. Yes, my husband and I are still Amazon shoppers. We're just going to have to be more careful now."
1,"Like the ones before, this book is a solid forensic and police procedural. A death row inmate is executed and his fingerprint later shows up in a current crime scene. How could that have happened? I particularly enjoyed seeing Kay's niece, Lucy, again, as she is 17 now and her own person, no longer a child. Lucy's computer skills continue to amaze. I look forward to reading the next in the series!(Note: There is a continuing bad guy introduced in this book who appears in the next two installments as well. I'd recommend reading this book before The Body Farm and From Potter's Field)"
1,"I could not give this book a full 5 starts. For whatever reason, the book seemed to ""bog-down"" and I just wanted it to end. I will continue to read the series, but this one was not my favorite."
1,Well paced novel with interesting characters and plenty of plot twists. Patricia Cornwell writes characters that are real and have depth. Her mastery of criminal science is wonderful and offers a sense of authenticity that few authors achieve.
1,"Very very good!!....I can usually figure out who did it, not this time. so many complicated twists and turns. Great read!!!"
1,The book was excellent. I was barely able to put it down. I love the Kay Scarpetta series and am excited when I get to read more.
1,"The good: The basic plot line is interesting- a man who has just been killed by the electric chair has his finger print turn up at a murder scene. The writing itself is good. The main character Kay Scarpetta and an old professor of hers are well `fleshed out'.The bad: Other characters are not well `fleshed out'. The plot never fully explains itself. Is the book about figuring out how a dead criminal could commit crimes - or is it about Scarpetta - redeeming herself in the eyes of everyone around her - after developing an anti-social workaholic tendency after the death of a loved one? The latter seems to be the path the author choose - leaving some of the twist in the plot unresolved. Though others in the story have made Scarpetta out to be the villain (on many different levels - as a family member, as a friend and as a professional) in the end her `goodness' is redeemed. How the bad guys in the story turn out seems to be unimportant - which I found to be a major flaw."
1,"This was my first Patricia Cornwell novel and I must say I was blown away. I never thought I'd warm up to a modern mystery writer the way I did with Agatha Christie and Dorothy L. Sayers, but Ms. Cornwell has displaced them both in my heart.C & E was by far the most fascinating book I've ever read. I sat up until the wee hours of the morning reading this wonderful novel, devouring every word, as I couldn't go to bed until I had finished it. The only disappointment was the ending. The killer came out of the blue, and there were too many loose ends.The story and characters were first rate and I intend to read all her other books. It's been a long time since I found an author I would be willing to pay hardcover prices to read."
1,I really liked this book. It is a page turner for sure. I would read before I went to bed and have to force myself to find a stopping point.I think that Patricia Cornwell is at her prime in this novel.
1,"Although this might be a good book to introduce issues in technical writing to someone considering the field, it is not useful if you want anything more than a broad overview. The information it contains varies widely in depth and is sometimes dated; for example, there are several paragraphs discussing the features of dot-matrix printers but only one short and incomplete list of the types of bindings available for professionally printed documentation. For some unclear reason, two sections on editing are separated by 10 pages on usability testing. If you are actually involved in technical writing, there are better books."
1,"This movie was not only NOT funny, but it was excruciatingly boring. I think Adam was channeling the Aristocrats. Whilst Aristocrats was not as funny as it thought itself to be, it was still better than this garbage."
1,"When the film first started playing, my partner and I looked at each other as if to say ""What on earth is this?..."" but we decided to give it a chance and let it play - for about half an hour before we couldn't bare to watch any more. The title says 'Funny' - it wasn't. The overall cover is totally misleading and gives you the impression it is a funny film by someone who had previously done a funny film - but it was in no way funny at all. The jokes were terrible, the script was terrible. Very disappointing."
1,Entertaining in places but spoilt by lots of crudeness and dirty talk that degrades woman. In the end I found nothing memorable or funny about this film. Sad for Adam to seem him in such a trashy film.
1,those guys ARE OVERATED!! ARE THEY REALLY FUNNY? NOPE. STUDIOS PAY THEM MILLIONS OF DLSS FOR THIS!!! C'MON AMERICA.. WAKE UP!!!
1,"This movie was perhaps Adam Sandler's worst effort. He seemed tasked with the burden of playing a man who was apathetic, but he came across as being apathetic about the role. The result was that his performance never engaged viewers to want to pull for him, which made the climax of the film lackluster. It was occasionally funny, considering the title and cast of comedians, who played comedians. The last 45 minutes, the film changes pace entirely, as if it wasn't floundering enough, and drops its attempts at weak comedy to push even weaker drama. Despite all the big names and cameo appearances, the only real stand out was Leslie Mann, who plays Sandler's ex. She was the only lively force in the cast, but sadly, alone she wasn't enough to bring it back into focus. You're not missing a thing."
1,"I love Leslie Mann and Eric Bana, but this is probably one of the worst movies I've ever seen! It was like 3 or 4 movie/plots/stories put together and just kept climaxing then letting down then rising action again and climax and letting down; over and over! I just kept wondering when it was going to end. I should have walked out like so many others did.Some may like, but it's NOT my cup of tea!"
1,"His movies seem to be going down hill. The only thing i found funny about this movie was Eminem snapping in it. Other then that, it is just not that funny. Dont let it trick you, only see this if its free."
1,"FUNNY PEOPLE is somewhat compelling and engaging film about a comic with a terminal illness that almost kills him and destroys his lifestyle and how he fights it and comesback to enjoy life,his friends and a beautifull woman he meets."
1,"This is not a typical Adam Sandler movie, which is not necessarily a bad thing, but it kind of is here. First of all it's not funny. It's about ""comedy"" but I wouldn't consider the movie itself to be a comedy, although there are a few funny things in it I suppose. This movie seems like it's all over the place. It has a long runtime but it doesnt really accomplish much. Some people might like the story, but it was pretty dull to me."
1,"Adam Sadler plays an unlikable comedian, George Simmons, who finds out he may be terminal with AML and tries an experimental drug. He decides to do stand up again when he meets comedian wanna-be Ira Wright (Seth Rogen) attempting stand-up. Sadler is impressed by Ira and hires him to write jokes and to be his personal go-fer. Ira finds out about the illness and convinces George to tell his family and friends about it. George plays the death card to patch up relationships, then suddenly he isn't going to die anymore. George re-examines his life, but even at mid-life he is still an immature a-hole. Everyone has sex but Ira, which seems to be a sad joke.I found the jokes and humor to be at best, lame. The language was crude and sexual. Brief nudity. Perhaps what is best about the movie is that it makes sit-coms look really lame. If you think a guy saying ""tweet"" over and over again, spinning around in a circle is funny, then this movie is for you."
1,"Intelligent, funny, sad, real, with a terrific dramatic performance by Adam Sandler.For a lot of it's length I thought it would be a truly great film, but some clunky, almostsit-com plot turns in the last 1/4, a little too much length, and not-quite-there supportingperformances in key roles hold it back and keep it a very good movie, not a great one.None-the-less, far better than the often cold response in got in most of the mainstream press."
1,"Too bad Adam Sandler could not have been given a better script. Funny People starts with promise as a Jim Carrey Man on the Moon type film and then drifts oddly into some sort of romantic comedy with repetitive c**k jokes. There are two movies here made from what seems like two first drafts. Maybe it is a marketing problem. Or, maybe just lazy writing. Sandler does a great job showing off the dark side of a comedian. Maybe Funny People would have been better as a straight drama."
1,"Wow, I usually like Adam Sandler & Judd Apatow/Seth Rogen films but this one came and left the theaters before I could get a chance to see it. I don't think I laughed once during the entire movie. Not even a chuckle. It seems as if no one was having any fun making this film. The unnecessary over the top crudeness of Apatow's ensemble doesn't seem to work with Sandler's schtick. I loved ""Knocked Up"" and ""40 Year Old Virgin"" but there doesn't seem to bee much chemistry with this group. I was waiting for ""Bruno"" to show up and throw in some more unnecessary genital conversation. I almost bought this, I'm so glad I only rented it."
1,"An acceptable movie, with some good moments by Adam Sandler, and some of the other new American comedy guys; but very far from his really ""funny people"" involved movies, like ""ANGER MANAGEMENT"" (with Jack Nicholson) or the hilarious ""LITTLE NICKY""."
1,"I seriously did not expect a dramatic look into the mind of a comedian when I rented this movie. They marketed this movie like the Forty Year Old Virigin and Knocked Up! When I rented the movie I expected a lot of humour and with so many funny actors I put way too much faith in it. My wife and I was so disappointed that we stopped watching it. I don't watch a lot of TV, but when I do watch something I want it to be worth while.If you're into these artsy films about the serious life of people in the spotlight, then you're going to like this film. However, if you're looking for humour like Adam Sandler's previous films (i.e. Happy Gilmore, etc) then you can forget about it.I give this film 1 star because this is not my kind of movie and it was advertised like a great comedy film not drama film. :/"
1,"Not much to say about this movie...i am a huge Adam Sandler fan, and i love him in anything....but this movie was looooong and booooring!!! The comedy skits in the movie weren't funny...at all...i guess if you enjoy hearing about masturbating...cocks...and farting....you would like it. Like i said, not much to say....i paid to watch it on my Suddenlink Direct Demand and i wish i could have my 3.99 back!!!!"
1,This is one of the worst movies I have seen. The dialogue is awful. There is ZERO humor. All the characters are boring and completely humorless.What a loser movie!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1,This movie was HORRIBLE! I don't know how anyone could give it 5 stars. This movie was the worst 2 hours of my life. I expected more out of an Adam Sandler movie. I felt like I was watching 2 movies at once. Any time someone asks me about this movie I tell them it's a waste and to rent something else.
1,"I saw this movie with my friend a couple of days ago. i said to her, this is real stupid, i could stop watching it right now and i could care less about the ending. She said, ""we saw this movie already"" and she is telling me what happens next so we start getting into an argument, she claims WE saw it and i said, Vat ? i am getting alzheimers?Finally we figured it out. we started to watch this movie together about 3 months ago and i lost interest and i zonked out.adam sandler and all the whos who in jewish comedy were funny in other movies. but this one really eats the bird!skip it!!!!!!!!!!!"
1,"Anything with Adam Sandler in it is supposed to be funny. This however, just, well, wasn't. I really do believe that this movie had potential, but there was so much going on, so many stories within the story, that they could have made 3 movies out of it.It's 2 and a half hours long. That's about an hour and a half too long for the main story plot. This movie honestly seemed longer than Titanic, or Gone With The Wind because it is so long and drawn out.There is very little humor in Funny People. The only good thing about it is all the major stars that pop up here and there, which is probably why, in my opinion at least, that this movie even made it to the big screen and didn't go straight to DVD."
1,"i cannot believe that an intelligent actor like adam sandler would degrade himself by acting in a degenerate , trailer trash movie like this,but i guess money makes some people do things that are beneath them. this movie is as funny as a sewer, all it is comprised of is endless and pointless profanity,virtually ever second word. the writer who has very little ,if not any intelligents, has substituted profanity for lack of intelligent writing.is the endless profanity suppose to make the male lead charactors appear more manly?. yes it is true that quentin tarantino movies has there fair share of profanity. however his movies use of profanity is justified as it is incorporated with intelligent writing. if you have very little or no intelligents or are a degenerate and trailer trash this movie will appeal to you."
1,A truly great example - of how terrible some movies have become!! Vulgar!! Offensive. Unnessisary nudity!! I usually love Adam Sandler - and can't believe he'd stoop so low in this role. Seth is highly likeable in this - but still swears and lowers himself as well. The woman who plays Adams 'romantic interest' is mostly great - but also stoops to swearing - blantant sexuality. The writing is the worst in this movie. This awful movie is 2 hours and 22 minutes long - but only feels like 5 hours. - And I could have spent my life doing something more interesting and exciting like watching paint dry or grass grow. I suggest skipping this movie altogether!! Tragic where movies have gone to. Much has been lost!!Scott MacNeil - comedian.
1,Honestly if you don want to hear a lot of swearing you wont like this. Let alone the story line was ridiculous. Wouldn't recommend!
1,"I normally love Sandler's movies but this was just horrible. None of it flowed right, jokes were horrible vand stupid and just all around made no sense. Don't waste your time and money on this."
1,The movie skips a few scene transitions and once it got to chapter 15 I couldn't watch any of the rest of the movie at all and the file online said it was 'like new.' The disc itself looks clean but it will not play at all in my 2 week old player and three other players I tried it in.......
1,I bought this for a Christmas present for my son. It arrived in perfect condition. He loves Adam Sandler and collects all his movies.
1,I must say I never liked Adam Sandler. There were so many more talented people who just never got a chance to be on the screen. I still don't get what's with Adam Sandler.Besides that I decided to give it a shot. It took half hour when I stopped watching.
1,my husband and I watched this and ended up watching something else. this will be a waste of your time
1,"It is wayyyyyyyy too long and completely aimless. Some may call it ""complex""; but I call it crap. There are a few little laughs here and there - but nothing that would make this worth sitting through. Even when one steps away from the fact that this was not intended to just be a comedy and rather attempts to tackle some more serious content.....it still sucks. Don't waste your money. Watch ""I love you man"" or ""Grandma's Boy"" or something that is actually entertaining. I wish someone had warned me."
1,"Judd Apatow has reached an absolutely new level of... sucking!!! Even Adam Sandler, one of my favorite actors of all times, sucked too, big time!!! There are funny movies, there are not so funny ones, there are stupid and ridiculous flix and... there's Funny People! Its name should be changed to ... what's the word for utterly unfunny? Almost 100% of jewish actors and they couldn't pull it off? That's odd!?"
1,How can anybody even smile with the kind of garbage Adam Sandler ALWAYS performs?This guy is just a moronic retard.DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON HIM.
1,"This is what Hollywood is calling humor these days? Must of been written by the lowly out of work writers during their strike! Crude, demeaning and a waste of my time!"
1,"The new ""stars of comedy"" make me miss the real ones. Why don't you try to learn from thy elders, like Mel Brooks, boys?Side note: Hollywood hasn't come up with real comedy since ""Meet the Spartans."" Anybody who forgot how brilliant it was needs to watch again ""I Will Survive"" at the end of the Spartans (it might still be on Youtube: SidgzLnh_W4)."
1,this is a great movie its not 40yr old virgin funny or knocked up funny but its a pretty good movie alot of famous ppl in it has alot of good funny parts 2 it. the only reason i think its not really funny is because theres none of those funny parts like knocked up of the 40yr old virgin has. dont pay attention to the reviews rent the movie or something if u like it buy it.
1,"I am big fan of Judd Apatow's work. i went into this hearing that its not like his other movies, that it has a more somber, serious tone. so my expectations were tempered. I liked it, i do agree with some other reviewers that it was probably a little too long, which is why I take off one star. But if you go in knowing this isnt a 40 year old virgin/knocked up style comedy then you wont be disappointed. with that being said, i can see why some people rated this poorly if thats what they thought they were going to see going in."
1,"This movie was not an original concept. The jokes were lame, as were the performances. The writer and director disappointed the audience by using Adam Sandler, Seth Rogen and Jonah Hill as a box office draw. When in fact, it wasn't worth the money to see this film in a theatre."
1,"Save your money. Your time can be MUCH better spent. This was one of the worse movies I ever sat through. Actually, I drifted away close to the end and was thankful I didn't waste that time. Its AWFUL."
1,Not worth the time.Pros: there were several good one-liners; introduced me to new comediansCons: excess foul language; adultry;
1,"So I just watched Funny People. For a movie that has an all star cast, it was a great movie. If you want to see a movie filled with laughs and a good story pick this movie up. I promise you won't regret it."
1,A delightfully funny story! A wonderful graphic novel that gives us a cat's-eye view of the Sephardic Jewish community in Algeria and then the Algerian community in Paris in the early 20th Century. It's a love story. Very funny and endearing. And the hero is a cat! This is a must for Joann Sfar fans.
1,This book came highly recommended to me by my Rabbi's husband. I was not disappointed! I think everyone will love this illustrated novel.Jorma
1,"The Rabbi's Cat is a wonderful book. I heard the author speak on NPR and got the book. The book is in the form of a comic strip, each box lovingly illustrated by the author. The pictures are wonderful, particularly of the cat. They are a joy to behold.Even better are the stories, anecdotes taken from the lives of the Jews in North Africa in the thirties. The stories are both very sad and hysterically funny. The cat has a sardonic turn of phrase that had me in stitches. Through the difficult medium of comics, the author has managed to capture the atmosphere of the time and place. Much of the book is given to musings about life, philosophy, love, God and so on. If you like a good discussion, you'll enjoy this book.Although the books can be enjoyed by non-Jews, I think if you don't know the basics of Judaism, you'll be missing the most vital part of the book. Of course, the book is so appropriate for the cat lover. The author clearly understands cats perfectly."
1,"The review with all the details about the depth and levels of the story hits the mark so I won't repeat it. However, I will emphasize what was not commented on. The Author is a very talented artist. He takes risks on many pages and it works, resulting in a feast of creative colorful dynamic drawings to accompany the text. The story wanes a bit in the final pages but the trip is artistically very satisfying. I hope there is a book to follow. I really enjoyed the characters and how they delt with their world and their beliefs."
1,"The Rabbi's Cat, by French artist and filmmaker Joann Sfar, is a whimsical, charming fable featuring a rabbi, his lovely daughter, and a host of other characters headed by a talking cat. Both protagonist and narrator, the cat often acts as a Greek chorus who comments, often sardonically, on the actions of the humans around him. Set in pre-World War II Algeria, with a lengthy detour to Paris, the beautifully illustrated narrative depicts a richly diverse world in which individuals seek to preserve their traditions while constantly interacting with people of other cultural, social and religious backgrounds. In this multilayered environment, the presence of an intelligent talking cat does not seem entirely out of place."
1,"This is the tale of a kindly Rabbi, his sweet daughter and the cat who loves her. The tale seems promising at first, until it delves into bitterness over God and those who love Him and follow His laws. The cat represents the glorification of sin itself, and delights whenever the book's characters fall into ungodly habits, judging them forever as hypocrites (taking no account into repentance and future avoidance of said sin). As is the case with most humanist literature the story down spirals from that point until it ends with the Rabbi losing faith in God. At this point the cat is truly happy with the Rabbi, thus giving the tale a 'happy ending'. In short, 'The Rabbi's Cat' is a tale structured to appeal to secular humanists, atheists and pagans who want to feel better about their self-serving, do as you feel, lifestyles.One more note: This book, despite the beautiful artwork and appealing cover, is definitely not appropriate for children."
1,"As someone who is interested in different cultures, I thought the book would be an interesting window into other people's thoughts. Instead, I open it to find a swearing cat (he uses the F word) denigrating religion and showing religious people as hypocrites, in a lame stereotypical way. Might be interesting to others, but its not interesting to me. Not only is it not suitable to children, but there are a lot of adults who would not want to be bothered with this kind of disrespect and vulgarity either. I wish I had been warned before I tried to read this book."
1,The way Bill Sloan wrote Jean Hill's side of her story of the assassination was in perfect terms. Jean Hill was the closest person to President Kennedy when the shots were fired and she saw where the shots came from and the feds tried to cover everything up. I believe that Jean Hill really knew and saw what happened that day in November. Anyone who would like to find out information about the assassination I believe this is the right book to read and hear what was truly covered up.
1,"Since writing my review of JFK: THE LAST DISSENTING WITNESS in 1998, I have been able to have my 35-page article - ""Jean Hill -The Lady in Red"" - included in Clint Bradford's JFK Assassination website. The address is: http://www.jfk-info.com/sitemap1.htm (scroll down for title)."
1,"Jean Hill's story changed with the wind. She saw next to nothing during the assassination, but used her unique location (and her active imagination)to keep herself in the limelight for years. It got so bad that even the conspiracy writers were shying away from her toward the end. It was laughable.Someone needed to ask her about the ""little dog"" she said was sitting in the car with JFK and Jackie. (Look at the original interviews- she actually said it.)This book is BS from stem to stern. Go read a fairy tale, at least there's a moral at the end. The only thing you find at the end of this book is your wallet a little lighter!"
1,"Very disappointing read. Starts with her tale of what she saw in 1963 then devolves into another ""MASSIVE GOVERNMENT CONSPIRACY"" work. Offering no documentation to support statements made. Unsupported statements about what her boyfriend said, claimed or saw. Lauds Garrison and his persecution of an innocent man in New Orleans. Originally I thought &#65533;The Assassination tapes&#65533; By George O&#65533;Toole was the worst effort in Conspiracy volumes but no more."
1,"The physics department at my school gets the mad ramblings of this man, and I usually end up with them (seeing as how no one else will read them). In a word, I sum these writings as ""nonsense."" Most of his ideas, aside from being mostly incoherant and physically absurd, also defy the time-tested and true concepts that the average high-school physics student could debunk. Furthermore, mixed in with these insane babblings, are religious and political ramblings, which he tries to pass off as the only possible truth.My recommendation, unless you want a good laugh or evidence of the under-education of many Americans, pass on this book. Any other use of your money would be a better one."
1,"I ordered the set of swords on December 9th (Sunday) and recieved the swords today (Wednesday, the 12). The Shipping was absolutly BLAZING! UPS Shipped with a Tracking Number made me confident in Sword Demon. Packaging was great and everything was alright. I would deffiently buy from Sword Demon again.These swords are UNSHARPENED. It would appear that Stainless Steel is not very good for sharpening them either. These are really ""Wallhanger"" katana's, But when your buddies come over and see them, they almost cry. These are just the coolest swords because of the movie. All the symbols and words on the blades are actually etched. The symbols and the like are the exact same from the movie."
1,"This DVD was entiled ""Seventh Cliburn Competion, 1985"" It was not the competion program, and did not even contain the winning performance. I consider it to be a total fraud and misrepresentation."
1,This kindly adaptation is a mishmash of gibberish. Amazon really needs to take more time in converting these. In this condition this should be free.
1,"Very good amount for the price. Smells nice too. However, the smell reminds me of clean laundry. I was wanting something a little different, a little younger. Still smells pretty good though. Curve smells better in the men cologne to me."
1,"Bought for my mom for Christmas she loves this perfume and it does actually smell pretty good however I was supposed to recieve my order by the 20th at the latest.its now the night of the 22nd and I am very worried it wont be here for Christmas. UPDATE: Spoke with Amazons customer service and they are replacing my missing item. It will be here tomorrow. Still sucks cuz it wasn't here in time for christmas, however I'm just glad they are replacing it for me."
1,"It smells like Gap heaven, Very nice. Beautiful color and scent! Can't wait to try Curve Crush when i'm done with this one."
1,I love Curve and this is a large bottle which make is a very good value. Highly recommended.
1,"The plot develops nicely then ends abruptly with an unsatisfying ending. It seems to the reader as if the author had reached her contractual page limit and slapped an ending onto the book. A superhuman villian was terminated too easily. The method of capture was not adequately developed. Several promising themes were not followed up by the author, especially the entriquing possibility that through genetic testing Gault's uncle may have been his father or the reason for the military being interested in the investigation. The author took one of the least interesting possibilites and handled it in a below average formulaic manner"
1,"I have read all Patricia Cornwell's book, and I think Ms. Cornwell has reached her best in writing this book.Suspense, mystery, New York, they all contribute to keep you awake until you finish the book."
1,"Here is a character I have enjoyed develop. But Kay is losing it. She should dump her niece Lucie, clean up her personal life (it's not nice to have an affair with a friends husband) and treat Det. Marino with some respect.As for Gault, if I pick up another Scarpetti book with his name in it... right back on the shelf"
1,"Well, that's no fun. Honesty is the best policy, right? This was the first of Patricia's books I had the displeasure to become acquainted with. I've tried reading another of her works, but I can't get over the simplistic writing with unnecessary adjectives thrown in for no apparent reason except, perhaps, to make the sentences longer and make the reader suffer from the protracted tripe. More than that, this book failed to make me care about the characters or about the outcome of the story"
1,"This book is a great read, a lot of fun. I'd recommend it to anyone who likes the genre. On the down side, I think that Gault is a little too evil -- he borders on the implausible with his ability to be one step ahead of the game. Also, I think Cornwell needs to develop Dr Kay a bit more; she's a good character, but needs more depth"
1,"This could be the worst novel I have ever read. It is also the first and last Patricia Cornwell novel I will ever read. There are so many problems with this book that they cannot be listed here, so here are but three points: 1) The main character, Kay Scarpetta, is an insufferable, humorless snob. I'd never before read a novel where I hated the main character. Great job, Pat! 2) About 90% of the novel is dialogue. Very bad dialogue. But this is understandable since Cornwell cannot write prose. 3) The story is predictable and boring, and the ending is utterly ridiculous. I'm astonished that this book was ever published, let alone made the bestseller lists."
1,"This supposed ""thriller"" is mind-numbingly dull and inept - I had to give up half way through."
1,"I loved Patricia Cornwell's first five novels; sadly, her sixth loses its edge.. I wanted to enjoy it.. but the plot labors on.. and I had a hard time finishing a book I couldn't wait to read. We lose Scarpetta's forensic ""grit"" and instead focus on a bizarre, rather boring computer plot.. I hope the next books in the series are better!"
1,"I'm not a fan of the crime writing genre, so I require more than some blood and guts and a few nasty frights to make me speak highly of a crime novel. Unfortunately, I cannot speak highly of From Potter's Field.I know more about dogs than I do about forensic medicine, so it makes me suspicious of the novel's factual integrity when I read that a murderer's eyes are ""as pale blue as a malamute's"", when in fact (according to the Alaskan Malamute Club of America), a malamute's eyes MUST be brown, never blue.It also made me laugh to think that all the crime agencies (and the media!!) in the USA would be completely ignorant regarding the closest relatives of the country's highest profile serial killer. Although if the good guys had known some basic details about the killer's family tree, Dr Kay would have been left twiddling her thumbs, so I suppose I should quit complaining.Well, I read the book right through to the end, and it kept me amused, so I have to give it one star."

1,"This is not your average kid's tape! Nancy Cassidy's wonderful alto voice invites even the musically challenged to sing along. As with all her tapes, there is a terrific mix of traditional and new music, use of many instruments, and varied musical styles. Even our one year-old dances when we put this on!"
1,"I don't like the fact that there was so much kiddie-pop music on the soundtrack,where as the first, second, and third movies had a blend of rock, techno, hip-hop, andrap... but this one had too much kid music for a movie that was (for the most part)dark!The only song on this album that fit the mood of the movies was 'Lights Out' by P.O.D.!That re-mix of the song is the only reason why I bought this album!Not recommended for the whole album, just that one song..."
1,I love the songs on this CD. Some of the songs make me want to run fast and punch stuff.
1,"After years of searching, which ended with a 400 or so page photocopied version with missing pages, I found this book. This book is the only in depth and detailed english language record of almost all vegetation on Okinawa and the Ryukyu islands that I know of. The information within is in both Japanese (an older style) and English. I know of no other place that this book exists aside from the post library on Torii Station."
1,Its a Game and Calling over Time are Edith Frost's best music. There are years between the two albums but the kinship is very very close. Each song on Its a Game will transport you to the world of sweet repose. Much like a summer or autumn friendship that simply fades this music is so hauntingly familiar to the feelings that linger after the time has left you in a state of misty eye wonder.Thanks to Edith for writing so candid and for the music arrangements that are simply perfect for her songs. Again thanks for the kinship and this is highly recommended.
1,"I read this book, It's a good source of information related to Chinese Medicine. I would call it an Art of Chinese Medical science."
1,Price and function are two of the main reasons I now own this camcorder. I have webtv so I can capture all of the stills I need and do it quite easily and without software and a computer.Keep it simple stan is definitly my mantra and this camcorder helps me do just that. More functions and options would just go to waste and be confusing.It is light and ergonomic and I got a free tripod and camera bag with mine at circuit city. I wouldn't buy electronics on line again (been there done that). A longer battery life would be all I would ask for .

But Karl had died, and Mother was ill, so Erna and Alfreda would have to make the journey to America alone, in third class on the Titanic. The two sisters, seperated at first by poverty and sorrow, soon become friends. But when the Titanic hits an iceberg and begins to sink, can they survive?"
1,"I originally bought one of Daniel's previous albums (the title had 'insomniac' in it). the previous album was mostly acoustic with melodic vocals. I bought it for my wife. she loved it. Next year, I purchased deflaboxe and the CD got thrown back at me. This album was NOTHING like the previous album I had purchased for her. so if you are like me and buying this album based on his previous work, think again. he took a completely different style with this album."
1,"In this experimental album, BÃ©langer shows his own dark & hidden garden. Obviously describing his fights against a depressive lifestyle and his deepest reflexions in his previous album (Rver Mieux - wich totally impressed me), he comes back with an exclusive musical and lyrical style mostly expressing how he concieves life as a constant fight (analogy: boxe). All songs bearing numbers instead of titles, he lets listners use their intelligence & imagination in order to ""feel"" the music his own way.One of the most impressive album from Quebec this year.I give 5 stars and two thumbs up."
1,"This children's book is a collection of nineteen folk tales collected and retold by the author from his travels throughout Central and South America. The book won the 1925 Newbery Medal for best contribution to American children's literature. I am oviously in the minority with my opinion: I only awarded the book two stars. I simply found it boring. But, this is obviously a good resource of South American folktales. Perhaps those who enjoy such material will like the book more than I."
1,This book was an anthology of 19 stories. I didn't like it because it was hard for me to make a mental picture in my head. I had to read almost every paragraph over. I could not comprehend at all!
1,"This book was about witches and possession. I do not believe in those things. I am a Christian! I did not like this book very much at all! I don't think this is a good book for kids to be reading, because they might have nightmares. Some of the stories are hard to comprehend. But if you do like those kind of things you will enjoy this book! Thank you for reading my review."
1,"I agree with the reviewer who is not the author. This is really a bad book. Totally not believable with no depth to the characters. I find it hard to believe this book is so popular overseas. I should consider writing for a living. I think the author is a little touchy, too. I guess it was too much for her that someone didn't like her boring book."
1,I just ordered this fudge. It looked so good and seemed to be priced well I thought I would give it a try. I have looked at just about every store where we live and can not find any maple fudge. I am hoping this will taste as good as it looks. I will send another feedback after I have had my first bite. Can't wait.
1,"Received this product in the mail and have worn it a few times. It's fairly comfortable for a bustier/corset style waist cincher. The boning is very supportive and higher quality then a bridal style corsette (most of those are cheap and just to get things to lay down more smoothly). I'm pleased with the product. One thing I will say on the negative side is that I'm rather short. These are more of a one-size fits all from what I understand and mine is a bit long in the torso since I'm 5'1"". Not an issue, it's meant that way so that it will cover under the chest down to about the belt so you dont have any random tire hanging over your pants, but I'm already fairly thin and this just causing the top wires to rub under my bra or jeans. Not the best for sitting, whereas a custom corset or one with a smaller torso likely wouldn't do that. The cloth is fairly comfortable and does as promised."
1,"I have four squeem shapewear items and i love them all. I do suggest finding your correct size, not the size you think you are. The terry cloth lining absorbs all wetness and i do see a difference in my shape. It flattens your middle so your blouses, tshirts and dresses look much nicer."
1,"I received my Squeem 1 month ago and was super excited when i first wore it but then the bone started sticking into my back right under my bra line it wasnt very comfortable not like when i tried it in the store and the top kept rolling over giving me the appearance of more rolls in the back. This was definaitely NOT the look i was going for LOL. Luckily i decided to dtop in the store where i first saw & tried it and spoke to one of the clerks who told me i had to pull it all the was down till it was half-way covering my butt & hips. EUREKA!! What a difference this made now i'm loving it and hardly leave home without it. I originally bought the XL nude now i'm getting ready to purchase the black vest in a L. Great product, my only complaint is that the bones could be firmer."
1,"I have the nude version of this chincher in small.I favour a vintage pinup look every day so the small waist is a main focus. I do have vintage styled cinchers and other authentic shapewear but they are expensive. This is a perfect substitute for day to day wear.As said in annother review you cannot wear this under clingy slinky clothes as it does ripple up at the front.I would recomend wearing a slip under it to avoid skin irritation. I wear a corset liner available from waist training specialists.The length is fine on me, going from just below the bra line down to the hip bones (I am 5ft 4)The cinching effect takes about 1.5 - 2 inches off my waist comfortably, enough to get into my vintage dior.I do not wear it enough to comment on the claims of permenant inch loss...but I think I will give it a try."
1,"I am pleased with this item. It would be helpful if it were slightly longer for my torso, but everyone is different of course.I wear it a lot and it has held up well. It is rubbery, so a base layer is important or you may break out when your body perspires."
1,I received this in the mail and followed the measurements on the site to get my size...when it arrived I could not fasten it as it was too small.........AND THERE IS NO REFUND.....So I didn't wear it or use it....and I am out $35.00 plus....for the privilege of not getting the product I asked for....one I could wear and use...will not buy from this seller again
1,this product does exactly what it says it does! the only issue is the first time you put it on it is pretty difficult to put on. the hook and eyes are stiff but once you do it a couple times it becomes much easier!! Don't give up it is worth it!
1,"I enjoyed this waist cincher! it corrects my posture, and makes me look slimmer!However, I think it stretched out a bit... Or I lost some inches!"
1,"I ordered the item according to the chart that was associated with the size and it ended up being to big. The item is also like it is made from rubber, but because I needed it for this weekend I don't know what I am going to do at this point."
1,"provides great support and slims me down by 2 inches when I wear it (I ordered a size small). The size chart is very accurate, it fits like a glove."
1,"I do believe this product is very good but, in my case, the cincher smooths my waistline more than anything. I am already petite, so the cincher doesn't significantly reduce my waistline. It does, however, make my waist look A LOT smoother and hour-glass like. You cannot really wear it under thin clothing, as others have pointed out, and, for me, it is impossible to wear it during hot summer days - the sweating and the rubber can create a rash situation - but I still recommend the product. It is a very good and very cool cincher. I think it can even be worn on top of clothing, for a goth or fetish look. It is well-made and makes clothes look better on you."
1,"I bought this item for my wedding dress! I wanted to make sure that I ""tried out"" the cincher before my big day and it works really well! I started out with this same item, in a Small - but it gave me ""back fat"" which I do not normally have...I returned the Small and opted for the Medium and it works like a charm. When wearing the cincher you have two ""size options"" with the double hook closure..which allows you to let it out more around the bust & tighter around your ""natural"" waist to create a better shape. It definately does the trick and is made of rubber material(def makes you sweaty...but it DOESNT move around) Totally worth it!Kinda painful...the boning pushes into my ""under/side boob"" probably because I am not super skinny immediately under my boobs...(size 36 DD)Ladies, if it helps..I am 5'2 135lbs busty, not super skinny but not fat(size 27 in jeans)"
1,"Love this. I had been looking in I don't know how long for this kind of product. I've had 2 babies so far and haven't found a product like this. I had an idea of what I wanted which was kinda like a coursette, but without all the wires showing or nothing rolling up. I came across this squeem cincher and had my doubts, but I've had it for a week already (I ordered all 3, black & beige waist cincher and beige body shaper that has straps)and I've already got used to wearing it everyday, it's pretty comfortable and best of all it gives you a nice shape and flat belly look. I love it, now I'm just hoping it will help me in losing some inces from my waist. I've read that it can last up to over a year, so deffinitly worth the money. Would recommend this to everyone."
1,I wore this for my wedding since I hadn't lost all of my pregnancy weight. It was great for a little bit. But then started getting a crease around my waist. I can't wear it anymore. Plus it made me feel very sick if I wore it for more than a couple hours. They suggest wearing it 8 hours? I couldn't do it. As soon as I take it off I am instantly better.
1,"I got this item within a few days of my purchase. It is exactly what I wanted -- I look a whole size smaller, instantly. I tried on the Squeem in a boutique and fell in love, but they were asking almost $200 for it! I highly recommend this item and the seller."
1,"I think the concept is great but with this particular product, they have these sections that are thicker rubber (or whatever the material is) and it literally pushed into my ribs every time I sit down. I commute a lot and have a desk job so its not a very pleasant experience to have that pushing and bruising your rubs every day. It would've been nice except for those thicker lines of rubber that aren't very flexible."
1,"Item was delivered quickly and it looks just like the picture. It is a great item because it does not roll up when you sit down. I've been looking for one like this for a while and would recommend it to anyone. Of course, you must use it long term to reshape your body but it is worth the money."
1,"After trying three different sizes,I still couldn't find one that fit. I first ordered a medium and it wouldn't even come close to hooking so I went up to size to xlarge which was waaay to big, my last possible option would be a large and it was still huge, wish I would have sent it back but was just tired of the whole process and kept it. The hooks are a pain as well and it is way over priced.....there is a zippered option on amazon that is much cheaper."
1,"When I received this, not only was it way too small for me, the first and only thing I noticed was the horrible smell that came out of the packaging! It was unbearable, sort of like a burnt rubber smell. There's no way I would recommend this to anyone. There are definitely other products on the market that do the job!!"
1,"The product did what it was ""supposed to"" which was to give me a waist, but it kind of just redistributed my fat. My waist was super tiny, but above and below (mostly below) I bulged like crazy, so I ended up just looking really oddly proportioned. My husband thought that I looked a little like an arthropod, so definitely not the sexy curvy lady that I wanted to be... I guess this product worked for other ladies, but for me, it just looked really unnatural and odd."
1,"Please note that I ordered three of these items as gifts and was surprised to see that only one arrived in its original packaging (with plastic cover and without any signs of it being worn). The other two had no plastic cover and had obvious streaks on the material. All three were advertized as ""New"" on Amazon site. Before you decide to buy new item, beware that you may be receiving item that someone else has returned so please inspect for any signs of item being worn (if fabric is stretched or not in its original plastic cover). These items should be advertized correctly and not sold as ""New"""
1,"I have one of those ""spare tire"" waists, but when I put this on, I had an hourglass shape... I've never had results like this with any other shapewear... But it does come with some side effects...Wore it to work for 8 hours, took it off to find that my skin was a grayish color (i'm black) and had lines (which turned to bruises) on my sides and lower back where it folded from sitting... I did like the way it gave me a much trimmer waistline, so the next day I wore a camisole under it and it was very comfortable. That experience did, however, give me more incentive to exercise and get fit so I don't have to depend on anything to ""make"" me look trimmer..."
1,"Typically I wear a medium adult women's sized shirt and a large in juniors- and I have pesky love handles thanks to my 2 beautiful babies :).This really works, well too- sucks you together and gives you that lift and confidence you want/need.The one thing that makes it not have 5 stars is that after a while it starts to bunch up in the middle (if you have some curve to you) and I'm not sure how to get it stretched out again.However, overall- if it didn't bunch up- I would give it 5 stars :)"
1,"I've been wearing the waist clincher for the last two years. I purchased a new one recently and it's not the same type of material of the previous ones i've brought. I thought maybe because i had lost weight, so i brought a smaller sizer, but that one didn't fit the same either. I thought i found a miracle when i first purchased the girldle through Amazon, but i have found my recent purchase has surely let me down..."
1,"When I first received this product I was plenty happy, I thought I had finally (after 8 years of switching from cincher to cincher) found the right one. It squeezed my belly enough that it actually got me to ""right-sized"" eating (whereas a lot of times I would get seconds, I found when I wore this cincher I could only eat one serving), which of course is wonderful. I didn't mind that sometimes it bunched up, I didn't mind that sometimes it left welts (that went away shortly after I removed the cincher), however, after about two weeks, on of the metal prongs came out, making the cincher essentially useless because it doesn't hold it's form. Even the cheap cinchers at Walmart held up better than this and cost only a fraction of what this cost."
1,I am 116 lbs. but after 4 kids (a set of twins) the tummy was not the same. squeem gives me a beautiful shape under my clothes...never look better. the only downfall it does not cut inches off or make you loose any body fat..after its off all the bulge comes out. It makes you look great thou...don't leave home without it.
1,With the type of closures and the amount of compression it is meant to give it's really difficult to put on. You need a hand to pull it closed in order to actually be able to close each of the 20 some odd hooks.
